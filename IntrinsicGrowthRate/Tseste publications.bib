abstract = {A way of estimating average daily mortality rates of female tsetse from ovarian age distributions was presented. This technique was applied to monthly biconical trap samples of G. palpalis taken during and after insecticidal (endosulfan) campaigns in the Bouafle region of Ivory Coast. A clear inverse relationship is demonstrated between the annual mean number of females per trap per sample at 10 separate sites and the mean annual mortality rates calculated for them. Local variation in the impact of insecticides is explained in terms of the grouping of the sites either side of a level of natural mortality above which tsetse population cannot be sustained through reproduction alone. A theoretical (mathematical) model for density dependent population growth is presented and applied to a particular control situation, that of the sterile insect release method. The model demonstrates that the effectiveness of any particular level of induced sterility (or mortality) is crucially determined by the natural resilience of the target population.},

abstract = {The generality and causes of Bergmann's rule have been debated vigorously in the last few years, but Bergmann's clines are rarely explained in the context of life-history theory. We used both traditional and phylogenetic comparative analyses to explore the causes of latitudinal and thermal clines in the body size of the eastern fence lizard (Sceloporus undulatus). The proximate mechanism for larger body sizes in colder environments is delayed maturation, which results in a greater fecundity but a lower survival to maturity. Life-history theory predicts that a higher survivorship of juveniles in colder environments can favor the evolution of a Bergmann's cline. Consistent with this theory, lizards in colder environments survive better as juveniles and delay maturation until reaching a larger body size than that of lizards in warmer environments. We expect similar relationships among temperature, survivorship, and age/size at maturity exist in other ectotherms that exhibit Bergmann's clines. However, life-history traits of S. undulatus were more strongly related to latitude than they were to temperature, indicating that both abiotic and biotic factors should be considered as causes of Bergmann's clines. Nonetheless, analyses of the costs and benefits of particular body sizes in different thermal environments will enhance our understanding of geographic variation.},

abstract = {Tsetse flies transmit trypanosomes, the causative agent of human and animal African trypanosomiasis. The tsetse vector is extensively distributed across sub-Saharan Africa. Trypanosomiasis maintenance is determined by the interrelationship of three elements: vertebrate host, parasite and the vector responsible for transmission. Mapping the distribution and abundance of tsetse flies assists in predicting trypanosomiasis distributions and developing rational strategies for disease and vector control. Given scarce resources to carry out regular full scale field tsetse surveys to up-date existing tsetse maps, there is a need to devise inexpensive means for regularly obtaining dependable area-wide tsetse data to guide control activities. In this study we used spatial epidemiological modelling techniques (logistic regression) involving 5000 field-based tsetse-data (G. f. fuscipes) points over an area of 40,000 km2, with satellite-derived environmental surrogates composed of precipitation, temperature, land cover, normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) and elevation at the sub-national level. We used these extensive tsetse data to analyse the relationships between presence of tsetse (G. f. fuscipes) and environmental variables. The strength of the results was enhanced through the application of a spatial autologistic regression model (SARM). Using the SARM we showed that the probability of tsetse presence increased with proportion of forest cover and riverine vegetation. The key outputs are a predictive tsetse distribution map for the Lake Victoria basin of Uganda and an improved understanding of the association between tsetse presence and environmental variables. The predicted spatial distribution of tsetse in the Lake Victoria basin of Uganda will provide significant new information to assist with the spatial targeting of tsetse and trypanosomiasis control.},

abstract = {Life-history theory predicts that older females will increase reproductive effort through increased fecundity. Unless offspring survival is density dependent or female size constrains offspring size, theory does not predict variation in offspring size. However, empirical data suggest that females of differing age or condition produce offspring of different sizes. We used a dynamic state-variable model to determine when variable offspring sizes can be explained by an interaction between female age, female state and survival costs of reproduction. We found that when costs depend on fecundity, young females with surplus state increase offspring size and reduce number to minimize fitness penalties. When costs depend on total reproductive effort, only older females increase offspring size. Young females produce small offspring, because decreasing offspring size is less expensive than number, as fitness from offspring investment is nonlinear. Finally, allocation patterns are relatively stable when older females are better at acquiring food and are therefore in better condition. Our approach revealed an interaction between female state, age and survival costs, providing a novel explanation for observed variation in reproductive traits.},

abstract = {The epidemiology of trypanosome infections of Glossina pallidipes was studied at a riverine site in the Zambezi Valley, Zimbabwe for a period of 13 months. Over 9000 flies were captured using a single trap. These flies were dissected, screened for trypanosome infection, sexed, and aged using both wing fray and (for females) ovarian category indices. Midgut infections were identified to species using recently developed DNA probes. The overall prevalence of mature infections was 5.5{\%}, comprising 3.1{\%} Trypanosoma vivax-type and 2.4{\%} T. congolense-type (which included very low prevalences of T. brucei, T. simiae and another Nannomonas species). The prevalence of infection increased with age. For T. vivax-type infections in flies aged by ovarian category this relationship could be described by a simple 'catalytic' model assuming a constant per capita rate of infection. For T. congolense-type infections this model tended to over-estimate prevalence in older age classes, implying that the rate of infection decreases with age, and/or that infected flies have higher mortality rates, and/or that a significant fraction of the population is resistant to infection. Prevalences of infection also varied between months. This variation was more marked for T. vivax-type infections and was negatively correlated with both temperature and rainfall. The shape of the age-prevalence relationship, however, did not vary significantly between months. These observations are not fully explained by variation in the age-structure of the tsetse population and are consistent with temporal variation in the rate of infection (rather than in the trypanosome developmental period or in effects of infection on fly mortality). Possible causes of this variation are discussed.},

abstract = {The spontaneous activity and visual responsiveness of starved tsetse flies, Glossina morsitans, increase exponentially for about 5 days after feeding until a pre-moribund decline sets in. Evidently the depletion of food reserves affects the behaviour of the fly. The causal relationship in this interaction was sought in two ways: (a) by looking for changes in nutritional parameters that follow the same trend and time course as the behavioural change, (b) by calculating the correlations between behaviour and these various parameters from concurrent data on individual flies. None of the three factors traditionally measured in tsetse (per cent hydration, lipid content, and residual blood meal) changed along a course similar to that followed by behaviour, nor did any expression of them correlate as well with behaviour (r = 0{\textperiodcentered}75, 0{\textperiodcentered}74, and 0{\textperiodcentered}71, respectively) as did the duration of starvation alone (r = 0{\textperiodcentered}79). On the other hand, abdominal weight and total body weight both changed in parallel with behaviour and correlated substantially better with it than did starvation time (r = 0{\textperiodcentered}85 and 0{\textperiodcentered}89, respectively); they also correlated very strongly with each other (r = 0{\textperiodcentered}98). It is suggested that the mean levels of the fly's behavioural thresholds are modulated on the basis of information about its overall nutritional state derived from monitoring its weight or abdominal volume, or perhaps some third variable with which these two are closely correlated. {\textcopyright} 1975.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: African animal trypanosomosis (AAT), or nagana, is widespread within the tsetse-infested belt of sub-Saharan Africa. Although a wealth of information on its occurrence and prevalence is available in the literature, synthesized and harmonized data at the regional and continental scales are lacking. To fill this gap the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) launched the Atlas of tsetse and AAT, jointly implemented with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in the framework of the Programme Against African Trypanosomosis (PAAT).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: The Atlas aims to build and regularly update a geospatial database of tsetse species occurrence and AAT at the continental level. The present paper focuses on the methodology to assemble a dynamic database of AAT, which hinges on herd-level prevalence data as estimated using various diagnostic techniques. A range of ancillary information items is also included (e.g. trypanosome species, survey period, species and breed of animals, husbandry system, etc.). Input data were initially identified through a literature review.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Preliminary results are presented for Ethiopia, Kenya and Uganda in East Africa: 122 papers were identified and analyzed, which contained field data collected from January 1990 to December 2013. Information on AAT was extracted and recorded for 348 distinct geographic locations. The presented distribution maps exemplify the range of outputs that can be directly generated from the AAT database.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Activities are ongoing to map the distribution of AAT in all affected countries and to develop the tsetse component of the Atlas. The presented methodology is also being transferred to partners in affected countries, with a view to developing capacity and strengthening data management, harmonization and sharing. In the future, geospatial modelling will enable predictions to be made within and beyond the range of AAT field observations. This variety of information layers will inform decisions on the most appropriate, site-specific strategies for intervention against AAT. Data on the occurrence of human-infective trypanosomes in non-human hosts will also provide valuable information for sleeping sickness control and elimination.},

abstract = {Phenotypic plasticity allows organisms to cope with environmental variation and may aid in the evolution of novel traits. However, whether phenotypic plasticity is beneficial, or if acclimation responses might be constrained to particular ecotypes is generally poorly explored. Here we test the beneficial acclimation hypothesis (BAH) and its alternatives for desiccation resistance to atmospheric moisture in mesic- and xeric-adapted Glossina species. Highly significant interactions among acclimation and test humidity were detected for water loss rates indicative of significant phenotypic plasticity. Ordered-factor anova was unable to reject predictions of the 'drier is better' acclimation hypothesis in xeric Glossina morsitans and mesic G. austeni. Evidence for the 'deleterious acclimation hypothesis' was found for mesic G. palpalis as expected from the moist habitats it typically occupies. By contrast, support for the 'optimal acclimation hypothesis' was found in xeric G. pallidipes. Little support for BAH was obtained in the present study, although other hypotheses, which might enhance fitness within the environments these species are typically exposed to, were supported. However, acclimation responses were not necessarily constrained to xeric/mesic ecotypes which might be expected if adaptation to a particular environment arose as a trade-off between plastic responses and living in a particular habitat. These results highlight the complexity of acclimation responses and suggest an important role for phenotypic plasticity in moderating environmental effects on evolutionary fitness in Glossina.},

abstract = {Flies are one of four superradiations of insects (along with beetles, wasps, and moths) that account for the majority of animal life on Earth. Diptera includes species known for their ubiquity (Musca domestica house fly), their role as pests (Anopheles gambiae malaria mosquito), and their value as model organisms across the biological sciences (Drosophila melanogaster). A resolved phylogeny for flies provides a framework for genomic, developmental, and evolutionary studies by facilitating comparisons across model organisms, yet recent research has suggested that fly relationships have been obscured by multiple episodes of rapid diversification. We provide a phylogenomic estimate of fly relationships based on molecules and morphology from 149 of 157 families, including 30 kb from 14 nuclear loci and complete mitochondrial genomes combined with 371 morphological characters. Multiple analyses show support for traditional groups (Brachycera, Cyclorrhapha, and Schizophora) and corroborate contentious findings, such as the anomalous Deuterophlebiidae as the sister group to all remaining Diptera. Our findings reveal that the closest relatives of the Drosophilidae are highly modified parasites (including the wingless Braulidae) of bees and other insects. Furthermore, we use micro-RNAs to resolve a node with implications for the evolution of embryonic development in Diptera. We demonstrate that flies experienced three episodes of rapid radiation—lower Diptera (220 Ma), lower Brachycera (180 Ma), and Schizophora (65 Ma)—and a number of life history transitions to hematophagy, phytophagy, and parasitism in the history of fly evolution over 260 million y.},

abstract = {The evolution of investment per offspring (I) is often viewed through the lens of the classic theory, in which variation among individuals in a population is not expected. A substantial departure from this prediction arises in the form of correlations between maternal body size and I, which are observed within populations in virtually all taxonomic groups. Based on the generality of this observation, we suggest it is caused by a common underlying mechanism. We pursue a unifying explanation for this pattern by reviewing all theoretical models that attempt to explain it. We assess the generality of the mechanism upon which each model is based, and the extent to which data support its predictions. Two classes of adaptive models are identified: models that assume that the correlation arises from maternal influences on the relationship between I and offspring fitness [w(I)], and those that assume that maternal size influences the relationship between I and maternal fitness [W(I)]. The weight of evidence suggests that maternal influences on w(I) are probably not very general, and even for taxa where maternal influences on w(I) are likely, experiments fail to support model predictions. Models that assume that W(I) varies with maternal size appear to offer more generality, but the current challenge is to identify a specific and general mechanism upon which W(I) varies predictably with maternal size. Recent theory suggests the exciting possibility that a yet unknown mechanism modifies the offspring size-number trade-off function in a manner that is predictable with respect to maternal size, such that W(I) varies with size. We identify two promising avenues of inquiry. First, the trade-off might be modified by energetic costs that are associated with the initiation of reproduction ('overhead costs') and that scale with I, and future work could investigate what specific overhead costs are generally associated with reproduction and whether these costs scale with I. Second, the trade-off might be modified by virtue of condition-dependent offspring provisioning coupled with metabolic factors, and future work could investigate the proximate cause of, and generality of, condition-dependent offspring provisioning. Finally, drawing on the existing literature, we suggest that maternal size per se is not causatively related to variation in I, and the mechanism involved in the correlation is instead linked to maternal nutritional status or maternal condition, which is usually correlated with maternal size. Using manipulative experiments to elucidate why females with high nutritional status typically produce large offspring might help explain what specific mechanism underlies the maternal-size correlation.},

abstract = {Giant insects, with wingspans as large as 70 cm, ruled the Carboniferous and Permian skies. Gigantism has been linked to hyperoxic conditions because oxygen concentration is a key physiological control on body size, particularly in groups like flying insects that have high metabolic oxygen demands. Here we show, using a dataset of more than 10,500 fossil insect wing lengths, that size tracked atmospheric oxygen concentrations only for the first 150 Myr of insect evolution. The data are best explained by a model relating maximum size to atmospheric environmental oxygen concentration (pO(2)) until the end of the Jurassic, and then at constant sizes, independent of oxygen fluctuations, during the Cretaceous and, at a smaller size, the Cenozoic. Maximum insect size decreased even as atmospheric pO(2) rose in the Early Cretaceous following the evolution and radiation of early birds, particularly as birds acquired adaptations that allowed more agile flight. A further decrease in maximum size during the Cenozoic may relate to the evolution of bats, the Cretaceous mass extinction, or further specialization of flying birds. The decoupling of insect size and atmospheric pO(2) coincident with the radiation of birds suggests that biotic interactions, such as predation and competition, superseded oxygen as the most important constraint on maximum body size of the largest insects.},

abstract = {Human African trypanosomiasis (HAT), or sleeping sickness, is caused by Trypanosoma brucei gambiense, which is a chronic form of the disease present in western and central Africa, and by Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense, which is an acute disease located in eastern and southern Africa. The rhodesiense form is a zoonosis, with the occasional infection of humans, but in the gambiense form, the human being is regarded as the main reservoir that plays a key role in the transmission cycle of the disease. The gambiense form currently assumes that 98{\%} of the cases are declared; the Democratic Republic of the Congo is the most affected country, with more than 75{\%} of the gambiense cases declared. The epidemiology of the disease is mediated by the interaction of the parasite (trypanosome) with the vectors (tsetse flies), as well as with the human and animal hosts within a particular environment. Related to these interactions, the disease is confined in spatially limited areas called "foci", which are located in Sub-Saharan Africa, mainly in remote rural areas. The risk of contracting HAT is, therefore, determined by the possibility of contact of a human being with an infected tsetse fly. Epidemics of HAT were described at the beginning of the 20th century; intensive activities have been set up to confront the disease, and it was under control in the 1960s, with fewer than 5,000 cases reported in the whole continent. The disease resurged at the end of the 1990s, but renewed efforts from endemic countries, cooperation agencies, and nongovernmental organizations led by the World Health Organization succeeded to raise awareness and resources, while reinforcing national programs, reversing the trend of the cases reported, and bringing the disease under control again. In this context, sustainable elimination of the gambiense HAT, defined as the interruption of the transmission of the disease, was considered as a feasible target for 2030. Since rhodesiense HAT is a zoonosis, where the animal reservoir plays a key role, the interruption of the disease's transmission is not deemed feasible.},

The carbonyl content was found to be associated with the physiological age or life expectancy of flies rather than with their chronological age. Exposure of flies to sublethal hyperoxia (100{\%} oxygen) irreversibly enhanced the carbonyl content of the flies and decreased their rate of oxygen consumption. Results of this study indicate that protein carbonyl content may be a biomarker of aging and support the general concept that oxidative stress may be a causal factor in the aging process.},

abstract = {The distributions of insecticide-treated cattle from sites in Tanzania and Zimbabwe were assessed from interviews with livestock owners, analysis of secondary livestock data and mapping technologies. The time-course of tsetse control operations at these sites were then simulated using a mathematical model that assumed diffusive movement and logistic growth in fly populations. A simulation of a tsetse control operation in Mudzi district, north-east Zimbabwe, was in accord with observations that the use of insecticide-treated cattle was unable to prevent substantial re-invasion of tsetse from Mozambique, consequent on the patchy distribution of cattle. The simulation was also consistent with the observed efficacy of a 10-km wide barrier of insecticide-treated targets deployed evenly at 4 km/(-2). Simulation of a control operation on Mkwaja Ranch in Tanzania was in accord with the observation that the use of insecticide-treated cattle reduced the tsetse population on the ranch by c. 90{\%}. Insecticide-treated cattle were used to better effect in the Kagera Region of Tanzania. Simulation of this operation predicts that the deployment of 35,000 treated cattle in the area would result in {\textgreater} 99{\%} control of the tsetse population, consistent with the observed decline, by 1-2 orders of magnitude, in cases of trypanosomiasis in the region. The greater success of the Kagera operation was due to the size and shape of the treated area and, particularly, to the restriction of re-invasion to 20{\%} of the perimeter, compared with {\textgreater} 80{\%} on Mkwaja. Simulation was used to assess how tsetse control could have been improved at Mkwaja. The results suggest that splitting herds into smaller, more numerous, units could have achieved some improvement but, in general, the disease problem would not have been solved by the use of insecticide-treated cattle alone. Only by deploying odour-baited targets in ungrazed areas, or in a 1-3-km barrier around the ranch, could substantially better control (99-99.9{\%}) have been achieved. Sensitivity analyses of the Mkwaja simulation showed that the general conclusions were robust to assumptions regarding cattle distribution and the rates of fly movement and growth. Properly managed and appropriately applied insecticide-treated baits are powerful weapons for tsetse control but should not be used without regard to potential levels of re-invasion, consequent largely on considerations of the size and shape of the treatment area and the density and distribution of the baits.},

GChitl is encoded by a 1.6 kb mRNA with a putative open reading frame (ORF) of 460 amino acids (predicted pI = 7.5, m.w. = 51kDa) that contains a signal peptide domain and two potential N-linked glycosylation sites. The ORF exhibits homology to various chitinases characterized from insects. It has the conserved catalytic site residues and the cysteine-rich 3′-end domain associated with chitin binding although the serine/threonine rich domain is apparently missing. Southern blot data indicate that GChit] is present as a single-copy locus in the Glossina genome. Northern analysis indicates that transcripts for GChit1 can be detected only from the fat body of adult flies. Similarly, chitinase activity could be detected in fat body but not in the gut or salivary gland tissues. The full-length cDNA was expressed in vitro in Drosophila S2 cells and the molecule was produced in a soluble form. Polyclonal antibodies raised against recGChitl could recognize a protein of about 50 kDa in adult fat body extracts. In addition to fat body, chitinase protein was detected by Western analysis from the milk gland tissue of pregnant females as well as from the intrauterine larval and pupal developmental stages. No chitinase specific mRNA transcripts could be observed, however from larvae and pupae. The intrauterine larva of tsetse may receive the protein from its mother via the milk gland route. The molecular characteristics of GChit and its product and the potential role of this chitinase in tsetse biology are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

All instars receive nutriment from the female's milk gland. During early pregnancy the rate of milk synthesis is greater than rate of uptake by the larva, thus causing expansion of the secretory reservoirs. After day 6, the volume of the secretory reservoirs decreases, but as is indicated by nuclear volume and larval growth the rate of synthesis remains high until day 8. Feeding activity of the adult female is maximal on day 1, levels off at 60 per cent up to day 6, and then declines sharply towards the end of pregnancy.

abstract = {Experiments carried out using teneral Glossina pallidipes indicate that flight can continue for at least 4 to 7 min after the thoracic proline reserves have fallen to low levels, suggesting that some other energy source is available. Earlier work suggests that alanine formed during flight is transported from the thorax to the abdomen where proline is resynthesized. Injection experiments using 14C alanine confirm that the transport mechanism does occur, that it is enhanced by flight, and that alanine is more rapidly incorporated into glutamate and proline in the abdomen than in the thorax. An analysis of published work shows that there is evidence for the involvement of residual blood meal amino acids even in the early stages of flight and supports the suggestion that they are of importance in prolonging flight. A decline in amino nitrogen during the early stages of flight is consistent with the action of glutamate dehydrogenase at this time. The poor flight durations in teneral flies may be due both to the low proline levels and to the absence of the residual blood meal. Very high energy consumptions are noted and appear to be related to the abnormally large musculature necessary for the fly's haematophagous and viviparous habits. {\textcopyright} 1976.},

abstract = {In much of sub-Saharan Africa, availability of standardized and reliable public health data is poor or negligible. Despite continued calls for the prioritization of improved health datasets in poor regions, public health surveillance remains a significant global health challenge.Alternate approaches to surveillance and collection of public health data have thus garnered increasing interest, though there remains relatively limited research evaluating these approaches for public health. Herein, we present a case study applying and evaluating the use of expert knowledge sources for public health dataset development, using the case of vector distributions of Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT) in Uganda. Specific objectives include: 1) Review the use of expert knowledge sourcing methods for public health surveillance, 2) Review current knowledge on tsetse vector distributions of public health importance in Uganda and the methods used for tsetse mapping in Africa; 3) Quantify confidence of the presence or absence of tsetse flies in Uganda based on expert informant reports, and 4) Assess the reliability and potential utility of expert knowledge sourcing as an alternative or complimentary method for public health surveillance in general and tsetse mapping in particular. Information on tsetse presence or absence, and associated confidence, was collected through interviews with District Entomologist and Veterinary Officers to develop a database of tsetse distributions for 952 sub-counties in Uganda. Results show high consistency with existing maps, indicating potential reliability of modeling approaches, though failing to provide evidence for successful tsetse control in past decades. Expert-sourcing methods provide a novel, low-cost and rapid complimentary approach for triangulating data from prediction modeling where field-based validation is not feasible. Data quality is dependent, however, on the level of expertise and documentation to support confidence levels for data reporting. Results highlight the need for increased evaluation of alternate approaches and methods to data collection. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

How a few such diseases have changed and the primary causes of change (urbanization, increased conflict, changes in water-resource management, ecological and environmental change, and reduced health service resourcing) are the subjects of the present review. The key impacts which these primary causes have on selected vectors and the infections they transmit are tabulated. The success of vector-control programmes against onchocerciasis and Chagas disease is discussed, and the methods used to evaluate the epidemiological impact of such controls are described. Bednet programmes for control of malaria are recognized as a potential future means of reducing morbidity and mortality in children. In contrast to the success achieved in limiting Simulium and Triatoma populations through vertical programmes, control of tsetse, whilst successful in Uganda, has not been utilized to stem recent epidemics of sleeping sickness in resource-stressed settings in Central Africa. Vector-borne diseases will continue to be a problem because of the adaptability of vectors, the potential problems of managing effective vector controls within decentralized health systems, and the influence of activities outside the health sector itself. Changes beyond the health sector can increase the problem posed by a vector and increase the frequency of transmission.},

abstract = {Tsetse exhibit a U-shaped age-mortality curve, with high losses after eclosion and a well-marked ageing process, which is particularly dramatic in males. A three-parameter (k(1) -k(3) ) model for age-dependent adult instantaneous mortality rates was constructed using mark-recapture data for the tsetse fly Glossina morsitans morsitans Westwood (Diptera: Glossinidae). Mortality changed linearly with k(1) over all ages; k(2) affected only losses in roughly the first week of adult life, and k(3) controlled the ageing rate. Mortality pooled over age was twice as sensitive to changes in k(3) as in k(1) . Population growth rate was, however, similarly affected by these two parameters, reflecting the disproportionate effect of k(3) on mortality in the oldest flies that contribute least to the growth rate. Pooled-age mortality and growth rate were insensitive to changes in k(2) . The same model also provided good fits to data for laboratory colonies of female G. m. morsitans and Glossina austeni Newstead and should be applicable to all tsetse of both sexes. The new model for tsetse mortality should be incorporated into models of tsetse and trypanosome population dynamics; it will also inform the estimation of adult female mortality from ovarian dissection data.},

abstract = {Tsetse are vectors of trypanosomes that cause diseases both in humans and livestock. Traditional tsetse surveys, using sampling methods such as Epsilon traps and black screen fly rounds, are often logistically difficult, costly and time-consuming. The distribution of tsetse, as revealed by such survey methods, is strongly influenced by environmental conditions, such as climate and vegetation cover, which may be readily mapped using satellite data. These data may be used to make predictions of the probable distribution of tsetse in unsurveyed areas by determining the environmental characteristics of areas of tsetse presence and absence in surveyed areas. The same methods may also be used to characterize differences between tsetse species and subspecies. In this paper we analyse the distribution of Glossina morsitans centralis, Glossina morsitans morsitans and Glossina pallidipes in southern Africa with respect to single environmental variables. For G.m.centralis the best predictions were made using the average NDVI (75{\%} correct predictions; range {\textgreater} 0.37) and the average of the maximum temperature (70{\%} correct predictions; 27.0-29.2 degrees C). For G.m.morsitans the best prediction was given by the maximum of the minimum temperature (84{\%} correct predictions; range {\textgreater} 18.8 degrees C), and for G.pallidipes, also by the maximum of the minimum temperature (86{\%} correct predictions; range {\textgreater} 19.6 degrees C). The following paper compares a range of multivariate techniques for making predictions about the distribution of these species in the same region.},

It is shown that, if R0{\textless}1, then the disease free equilibrium is locally asymptotically stable; whereas if R0{\textgreater}1, then it is unstable. Thus, R0 is a threshold parameter for the model. An analysis of the local centre manifold yields a simple criterion for the existence and stability of super- and sub-threshold endemic equilibria for R0 near one. This criterion, together with the definition of R0, is illustrated by treatment, multigroup, staged progression, multistrain and vector-host models and can be applied to more complex models. The results are significant for disease control.},

abstract = {Many studies of offspring size focus on differences in maternal investment that arise from ecological factors such as predation or competition. Classic theory predicts that these ecological factors will select for an optimal offspring size, and therefore that variation in a given environment will be minimized. Yet recent evidence suggests maternal traits such as size or age could also drive meaningful variation in offspring size. The generality of this pattern is unclear, as some studies suggest that it may represent non-adaptive variation or be an artifact of temporal or spatial differences in maternal environments. To clarify this pattern, we asked how maternal size, age and condition are related to each other in several populations of the swordtail Xiphophorus birchmanni. We then determined how these traits are related to offspring size, and whether they could resolve unexplained intra-population variation in this trait. We found that female size, age, and condition are correlated within populations; at some of these sites, older, larger females produce larger offspring than do younger females. The pattern was robust to differences among most, but not all, sites. Our results document a pattern that is consistent with recent theory predicting adaptive age- and size-dependence in maternal investment. Further work is needed to rule out non-adaptive explanations for this variation. Our results suggest that female size and age could play an under-appreciated role in population growth and evolution.},

abstract = {Quantitative analysis and mathematical models are useful tools in informing strategies to control or eliminate disease. Currently, there is an urgent need to develop these tools to inform policy to achieve the 2020 goals for neglected tropical diseases (NTDs). In this paper we give an overview of a collection of novel model-based analyses which aim to address key questions on the dynamics of transmission and control of nine NTDs: Chagas disease, visceral leishmaniasis, human African trypanosomiasis, leprosy, soil-transmitted helminths, schistosomiasis, lymphatic filariasis, onchocerciasis and trachoma. Several common themes resonate throughout these analyses, including: the importance of epidemiological setting on the success of interventions; targeting groups who are at highest risk of infection or re-infection; and reaching populations who are not accessing interventions and may act as a reservoir for infection,. The results also highlight the challenge of maintaining elimination 'as a public health problem' when true elimination is not reached. The models elucidate the factors that may be contributing most to persistence of disease and discuss the requirements for eventually achieving true elimination, if that is possible. Overall this collection presents new analyses to inform current control initiatives. These papers form a base from which further development of the models and more rigorous validation against a variety of datasets can help to give more detailed advice. At the moment, the models' predictions are being considered as the world prepares for a final push towards control or elimination of neglected tropical diseases by 2020.},

abstract = {Despite slow nutrient supply to the subtropical surface ocean, the rates of annual inorganic carbon uptake and net oxygen production are similar to those of nutrient-rich high-latitude waters. This surprisingly high subtropical carbon uptake cannot be fully accounted for by sediment trap-collected sinking particles and the downward mixing of suspended and dissolved organic carbon. We propose an explanation for these paradoxical observations: gel-like organic matter rich in carbon but poor in nutrients, akin to transparent exopolymer particles, is produced by phytoplankton under nutrient limitation, and a portion sinks into the shallow subsurface, where it is respired by heterotrophic bacteria. This organic matter would evade detection by sediment traps, effectively representing an additional (sinking-driven) source of dissolved organic carbon to the subsurface. Building on existing evidence for the production of such nutrient-poor organic matter in surface waters, we describe evidence for its decomposition in the shallow subsurface of the Sargasso Sea. First, oxygen at these depths is consumed over the summer without comparable production of nitrate. Second, a seasonal change in the},

These efficiencies of conversion determine the overall yields when food or storage tissue is converted into body tissue or into metabolic energy. A biochemical approach to the estimation of these efficiencies uses stoichiometry and a simplified description of tsetse metabolism to derive estimates of the yields, for a given amount of each substrate, of conversion product, by-products, and exchanged gases. This biochemical approach improves on estimates obtained through calorimetry because the stoichiometric calculations explicitly include the inefficiencies and costs of the reactions of conversion. However, the biochemical approach still overestimates the actual conversion efficiency because the approach ignores all the biological inefficiencies and costs such as the inefficiencies of leaky membranes and the costs of molecular transport, enzyme production, and cell growth.},

Climate change, land use, and transport vectors interact in complex ways to determine the spread of native and non-native invasive species, pathogens, and their effects on ecosystem dynamics. Early detection and in-depth understanding of invasive species and infectious diseases will require an integrated network of research platforms and information exchange to identify hotspots of invasion or disease emergence. Partnerships with state and federal agencies that monitor the spread and impacts of invasive species and pathogens will be critical in developing a national data and research network that can facilitate a full understanding of the resulting effects on ecosystems and society. Citizen science can also play a role; individuals can report new invasions, record phenological changes associated with invasions or disease outbreaks, and can participate in efforts such as the Breeding Bird Survey, which may reveal long-term biotic change following species invasions and disease spread. The ecological and societal impacts of invasive species and pathogens differ across gradients of climate and land use, and in the presence of global climate change may exacerbate both their propagation and impacts. Understanding the interactions of invasive species, disease vectors, and pathogens with other drivers of ecosystem change is critical to human health and economic well-being.},

Virgin females of Glossina morsitans orientalis Vanderplank derived from puparia collected in the field in Rhodesia were exposed in the laboratory to virgin males that had been ren dered permanently sterile and later to normal virgin males. The number of progened produced indicated that females had mated more than once. Females inseminated once with sterile sperm and then kept for 0, 24 or 96 hours before being allowed to mate with fertile males produced progressively fewer progeny as the interval between matings increased, but about equal numbers of progeny 29-56 days later, irrespective of the interval. The reduction in progeny produced during the first 28 days pre sumably resulted from the relation between the time of the second insemination and ovulation. Females given the opportunity to mate repeatedly for {\%} hours vvith their first mates also mated again with new groups of males, but less readily. The com bined series of experiments showed that females of G. morsitans Westw will accept multiple insemination in the laboratory [cf. RAE B 37 4]. The frequency with it occurs in nature is not known. When groups of males were exposed to successive new groups of virgin females, the minimum mean number of females inseminated per male was 4.9 in one series of experiments and 5.6 in another. However the later inseminations were progressively less effective, and once the complement of sperm of an individual male was depleted, fertility was not recovered. Acceptance of second matings by females and the multiple matings of males are not eepected to affect adversely the use of sterile males for population control, and the first might enhance the rate of control by reducing the fertility of females previously inseminated with normal sperm.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Tsetse flies (Genus: Glossina) are the sole cyclical vectors of African trypanosomoses. Despite their economic and public health impacts in sub-Saharan Africa, it has been decades since the latest distribution maps at the continental level were produced. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations is trying to address this shortcoming through the Atlas of tsetse and African animal trypanosomosis.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: For the tsetse component of the Atlas, a geospatial database is being assembled which comprises information on the distribution and trypanosomal infection of Glossina species. Data are identified through a systematic literature review. Field data collected since January 1990 are included, with a focus on occurrence, apparent density and infection rates of tsetse flies. Mapping is carried out at the level of site/location. For tsetse distribution, the database includes such ancillary information items as survey period, trap type, attractant (if any), number of traps deployed in the site and the duration of trapping (in days). For tsetse infection, the sampling and diagnostic methods are also recorded.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: As a proof of concept, tsetse distribution data for three pilot countries (Ethiopia, Kenya and Uganda) were compiled from 130 peer-reviewed publications, which enabled tsetse occurrence to be mapped in 1266 geographic locations. Maps were generated for eight tsetse species (i.e. G. brevipalpis, G. longipennis, G. fuscipes fuscipes, G. tachinoides, G. pallidipes, G. morsitans submorsitans, G. austeni and G. swynnertoni). For tsetse infection rates, data were identified in 25 papers, corresponding to 91 sites.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: A methodology was developed to assemble a geo-spatial database on the occurrence, apparent density and trypanosomal infection of Glossina species, which will enable continental maps to be generated. The methodology is suitable for broad brush mapping of all tsetse species of medical and veterinary public health importance. For a few tsetse species, especially those having limited economic importance and circumscribed geographic distribution (e.g. fusca group), recently published information is scanty or non-existent. Tsetse-infested countries can adopt and adapt this approach to compile national Atlases, which ought to draw also on the vast amount of unpublished information.},

abstract = {The biology and behaviour of biting insects is a vitally important aspect in the spread of vector-borne diseases. This paper aims to determine, through the use of mathematical models, what effect incorporating vector senescence and realistic feeding patterns has on disease. A novel model is developed to enable the effects of age- and bite-structure to be examined in detail. This original PDE framework extends previous age-structured models into a further dimension to give a new insight into the role of vector biting and its interaction with vector mortality and spread of disease. Through the PDE model, the roles of the vector death and bite rates are examined in a way which is impossible under the traditional ODE formulation. It is demonstrated that incorporating more realistic functions for vector biting and mortality in a model may give rise to different dynamics than those seen under a more simple ODE formulation. The numerical results indicate that the efficacy of control methods that increase vector mortality may not be as great as predicted under a standard host-vector model, whereas other controls including treatment of humans may be more effective than previously thought.},

abstract = {Trypanosomiasis is a neglected tropical disease of both livestock and humans. Although pastoral communities of the Maasai Steppe have been able to adapt to trypanosomiasis in the past, their traditional strategies are now constrained by changes in climate and land regimes that affect their ability to move with their herds and continually shape the communities' vulnerability to trypanosomiasis. Despite these constraints, information on communities' vulnerability and adaptive capacity to trypanosomiasis is limited. A cross-sectional study was therefore conducted in Simanjiro and Monduli districts of the Maasai Steppe to establish pastoralists' vulnerability to animal trypanosomiasis and factors that determined their adaptation strategies. A weighted overlay approach in ArcGIS 10.4 was used to analyze vulnerability levels while binomial and multinomial logistic regressions in R 3.3.2 were used to analyze the determinants of adaptation. Simanjiro district was the most vulnerable to trypanosomiasis. The majority (87.5{\%}, n = 136) of the respondents were aware of trypanosomiasis in animals, but only 7.4{\%} (n = 136) knew about the human form of the disease. Reported impacts of animal trypanosomiasis were low milk production (95.6{\%}, n = 136), death of livestock (96.8{\%}, n = 136) and emaciation of animals (99.9{\%}, n = 136). Crop farming was the most frequently reported animal trypanosomiasis adaptation strategy (66{\%}, n = 136). At a 95{\%} confidence interval, accessibility to livestock extension services ($\beta$ = 7.61, SE = 3.28, df = 135, P = 0.02), years of livestock keeping experience ($\beta$ = 6.17, SE = 1.95, df = 135, P = 0.001), number of cattle owned ($\beta$ = 5.85, SE = 2.70, df = 135, P = 0.03) and membership in associations ($\beta$ = − 4.11, SE = 1.79, df = 135, P = 0.02) had a significant impact on the probability of adapting to animal trypanosomiasis. {\textcopyright} 2017 EcoHealth Alliance},

abstract = {Aim Most deciduous species of dry monsoon forests in Thailand and India form new leaves 1-2 months before the first monsoon rains, during the hottest and driest part of the year around the spring equinox. Here we identify the proximate causes of this characteristic and counterintuitive 'spring-flushing' of monsoon forest trees. Location Trees of 20 species were observed in semi-deciduous dry monsoon forests of northern Thailand with a 5-6-month-long severe dry season and annual rainfall of 800-1500 mm. They were growing on dry ridges (dipterocarp-oak forest) or in moist gullies (mixed deciduous-evergreen forest) at 680-750 m altitude near Chiang Mai and in a dry lowland stand of Shorea siamensis in Uthai Thani province. Methods Two novel methods were developed to analyse temporal and spatial variation in vegetative dry-season phenology indicative of differences in root access to subsoil water reserves. Results Evergreen and leaf exchanging species at cool, moist sites leafed soon after partial leaf shedding in January-February. Drought-resistant dipterocarp species were evergreen at moist sites, deciduous at dry sites, and trees leafed soon after leaf shedding whenever subsoil water was available. Synchronous spring flushing of deciduous species around the spring equinox, as induced by increasing daylength, was common in Thailand's dipterocarp-oak forest and appears to be prevalent in Indian dry monsoon forests of the Deccan peninsula with its deep, water-storing soils. Main conclusions In all observed species leafing during the dry season relied on subsoil water reserves, which buffer trees against prolonged climatic drought. Implicitly, rainfall periodicity, i.e. climate, is not the principal determinant of vegetative tree phenology. The establishment of new foliage before the summer rains is likely to optimize photosynthetic gain in dry monsoon forests with a relatively short, wet growing season.},

abstract = {With increasing urbanisation and predictions of increased frequency of heat waves under projected climate change scenarios, one strategy that has been suggested to address both adaptation and mitigation for urban areas is the increased use of greenspace. A number of studies have analysed this strategy through the use of empirical, analytical methods, or numerical methods. These tend to focus on city or regional scale changes in land use with only a broad categorisation of greenspace type. This study tests seven greenspace scenarios that might be applied at a block or neighbourhood level and the resulting microclimate changes that can be achieved through such applications for a temperate city in northwest England. Using a suburban commercial site in Manchester, UK as the case study area, the research utilises the urban microclimate model ENVI-met to compare the changes in air and surface temperatures on a warm summer day in July 2010 (approximately 4. °C above the rural reference July average maximum temperature). The modelling demonstrates that even in suburban areas in temperate cities a 5{\%} increase in mature deciduous trees can reduce mean hourly surface temperatures by 1. °C over the course of a summer's day. A marked increase in air temperature of 3.2. °C at mid-day is modelled for the worst case scenario of replacing all current vegetation with asphalt. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

Trypomastigotes of T. cruzi and amastigotes of L. mexicana are destroyed within endocytic vacuoles of chicken macrophages, independently of the temperature of incubation (33 or 37° C), while multiply within mouse macrophages. By use of horseradish peroxidase labeling of the chicken macrophage lysosomes we show that fusion of lysosomes with phagocytic vacuoles containing T. cruzi occurs. We also show, using ultrastructural cytochemistry, the presence of H2O2 within endocytic vacuoles containing T. cruzi. These results suggest that cellular mechanisms, besides the well known effect of complement, play some role in the refractiveness of birds to trypanosomatids.},

Coinciding with larval descent, the female becomes conspicuously restless. The activity pattern monitored by measuring oxygen consumption shows a progression of four discrete stages of activity before and after parturition. Immediately following parturition, the female emits a low frequency sound of 5.8 min duration that differs markedly from sounds produced during feeding or mating. Parturition can be blocked by neck-ligation of the female, thus suggesting a crucial role for the brain. Both neural and hormonal pathways appear to be involved. Transection of the nerve that innervates the uterine muscles reduces the incidence of successful parturition, and parturition in neck-ligated females can be stimulated by transfusion of haemolymph from females that have recently given birth. When parturition is blocked, larvae are retained in utero but eventually pupariate after a delay of 2.3 days. {\textcopyright} 1983.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Tick and tsetse-borne diseases (TTBDs) constrain livestock production in tropical and subtropical regions of the world. Of this community of endemic diseases, East coast fever (T. parva) is the most important tick-borne disease (TBD) accounting for 70{\%} of all losses due to TBDS in this region where control efforts target either tsetse or TBDs and seldom both. In those instances where simultaneous pyrethroid insecticide TTBD control is implemented, collateral benefits of tsetse control on TBD control have not been quantified. In the interest of guiding future TTBD control efforts, the effect of restricting pyrethroid insecticides to the legs, belly and ears (RAP) of cattle for tsetse and trypanosomiasis control on T. parva prevalence in crop-livestock production systems in Tororo district, south-eastern Uganda was determined. METHODS We randomly allocated 16 villages to diminazene diaceturate (DA) and 3 graded RAP (25{\%}, 50{\%} and 75{\%} of village herd sprayed respectively) treatment regimens. All cattle were ear-tagged, treated with diminazene diaceturate (DA) and those in regimens 2-4 received monthly graded RAP. Blood samples taken fourteen days post DA treatment and once three monthly were analysed by molecular techniques for T. parva. RESULTS In total, 8,975 samples from 3,084 animals were analysed. Prevalence of T. parva varied between 1-3{\%} in different treatment regimens. RAP regimens were associated with slightly lower average risk of infection compared to DA. However, the confidence interval was broad and the result was not statistically significant. There was no evidence of a dose response relationship between graded RAP and T. parva prevalence. These findings are discussed herein with regard to endemic stability development to different TBDs. CONCLUSIONS We found only a slight effect of RAP on T. parva infection. Since sample size determination was based on trypanosomes incidence, the study was underpowered given the low T. parva prevalence. While the findings need to be confirmed in future studies, the observed slight reduction in the risk of infection with T. parva might not compromise endemic stability.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 The Author(s). Background: Malaria vector mosquitoes with exophilic and zoophilic tendencies, or with a high acceptance of alternative blood meal sources when preferred human blood-hosts are unavailable, may help maintain low but constant malaria transmission in areas where indoor vector control has been scaled up. This residual transmission might be addressed by targeting vectors outside the house. Here we investigated the potential of insecticide-treated cattle, as routinely used for control of tsetse and ticks in East Africa, for mosquito control. Methods: The malaria vector population in the study area was investigated weekly for 8 months using two different trapping tools: light traps indoors and cattle-baited traps (CBTs) outdoors. The effect of the application of the insecticide deltamethrin and the acaricide amitraz on cattle on host-seeking Anopheles arabiensis was tested experimentally in field-cages and the impact of deltamethrin-treated cattle explored under field conditions on mosquito densities on household level. Results: CBTs collected on average 2.8 (95{\%} CI: 1.8-4.2) primary [Anopheles gambiae (s.s.), An. arabiensis and An. funestus (s.s.)] and 6.3 (95{\%} CI: 3.6-11.3) secondary malaria vectors [An. ivulorum and An. coustani (s.l.)] per trap night and revealed a distinct, complementary seasonality. At the same time on average only 1.4 (95{\%} CI: 0.8-2.3) primary and 1.1 (95{\%} CI: 0.6-2.0) secondary malaria vectors were collected per trap night with light traps indoors. Amitraz had no effect on survival of host-seeking An. arabiensis under experimental conditions but deltamethrin increased mosquito mortality (OR 19, 95{\%} CI: 7-50), but only for 1 week. In the field, vector mortality in association with deltamethrin treatment was detected only with CBTs and only immediately after the treatment (OR 0.25, 95{\%} CI: 0.13-0.52). Conclusions: Entomological sampling with CBTs highlights that targeting cattle for mosquito control has potential since it would not only target naturally zoophilic malaria vectors but also opportunistic feeders that lack access to human hosts as is expected in residual malaria transmission settings. However, the deltamethrin formulation tested here although used widely to treat cattle for tsetse and tick control, is not suitable for the control of malaria vectors since it causes only moderate initial mortality and has little residual activity.},

abstract = {The number of tsetse visiting a black cylindrical model (designed to look like a small host animal) in the Zambesi Valley, Zimbabwe, was estimated by catching them on an expanse of electric netting placed next to the model. The number which alighted was found by electrocuting the flies on the surface of the model on other occasions when the netting was absent. About half the Glossina morsitans morsitans Westw. visiting a stationary small model (a black drum 57 cm long and 37 cm in diametter) in the absence of ox odour alighted on it, but virtually none of the G. pallidipes Aust. alighted. When the linear dimensions of the standard model were increased threefold, about 1{\textperiodcentered}5 times as many tsetse visited its close vicinity. Of these, nearly all the G. morsitans and about one-third of the G. pallidipes alighted on the model. Four to seven times as many tsetse visited the models when the odour of one ox was dispensed near them. When odour was present, about 1{\textperiodcentered}5 times as many tsetse visited the large model as visited the small one. Some 55–85{\%} of G. morsitans visiting the small model in the presence of ox odour alighted, but only about 30{\%} of the male and 20{\%} of the female G. pallidipes alighted. The latter percentages increased to 53 and 62 when the large model was used. A smaller percentage of G. morsitans females landed on the large model in the presence of ox odour than in its absence. With mobile models, significantly more tsetse were taken if electric nets were appended fore and aft of the model. In the absence of electric nets, 2–30 times as many tsetse landed on the large model as on the small one, the effect being greater for female G. morsitans than for males and much greater for G. pallidipes than for G. morsitans. The percentage of visiting flies of both sexes and species that landed was greater when the large model was used. {\textcopyright} 1980, Cambridge University Press. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {In Zimbabwe, studies were made of the effect of host behaviour on the feeding success of Glossina pallidipes Austen and G. morsitans morsitans Westwood (Diptera: Glossinidae) attracted to cattle of different age and sex. The mean feeding rates for male and female G. pallidipes attracted to oxen were 60{\%} and 58{\%}, respectively, compared to 33{\%} and 53{\%} for male and female G. m. morsitans. The feeding rate of G. pallidipes varied between oxen and was inversely correlated with a host's rate of defensive leg movements, which, in turn, was positively correlated with the density of Stomoxys spp. (Diptera: Muscidae) caught in the vicinity of the host. Tsetse were significantly less successful in feeding from young cattle. For G. pallidipes, the feeding rate on calves ({\textless} 6 months) was 11{\%}, whereas for male and female G. m. morsitans the rates were 12{\%} and 20{\%}, respectively. Significantly lower feeding rates were apparent for cattle aged up to 2 years, when the feeding rate for G. pallidipes (31{\%}) was still significantly less than that on mature oxen (68{\%}). Feeding rates for G. pallidipes on adult female cattle were lower than those on oxen (45{\%} vs. 61{\%}). The lower feeding rates in young animals were attributed to higher rates of defensive movements. The results suggest that higher rates of defensive activities by young cattle reduce the risk of them contracting trypanosomiasis.},

The calves were produced in the Ankole District of south-western Uganda as a part of a beef cattle research program designed to provide information to support a commercial ranching development scheme in an area that had been cleared of the tsetse fly. Breed of sire effects were significant for birth and weaning weight, and breed of dam effects were significant for birth, weaning and 12-mo weight. Breed of sire and breed of dam effects that were significant showed the Boran breed to have higher values for all traits except breed of dam effects on birth weight; calves with Red Poll dams were 3.6 kg heavier (P less than .01) at birth than calves with Boran dams. Steers were significantly heavier than heifers at all ages except birth. Young cows (3 and 4 yr old) and old cows (9 yr old and older) produced calves that weighed significantly less at weaning, 12 mo and 18 mo than calves with dams that were 5 through 8 yr old. Heterosis effects were significant for weights at weaning, 12, 18, 24 and 30 mo of age; generally, heterosis effects on weight increased with age. Heterosis effects approached significance for survival from birth to 30 mo. Additive maternal effects were significant for birth weight; crossbred calves with Boran dams weighted 6.0 kg less at birth than crossbred calves with Red Poll dams. There was a reversal of the reciprocal effect between prenatal and postnatal gains; crossbred calves with Boran dams weighed 7.1 kg more at weaning than crossbred calves with Red Poll dams. Examination of additive direct effects showed the Boran breed to be significantly heavier than the Red Poll breed for birth weight and weaning weight. Additive direct effects showed the Boran breed to have generally higher (P greater than .05) values than the Red Poll breed for most other traits analyzed. Differences between straightbreds of the Boran and Red Poll breeds, which reflect differences in additive maternal and additive direct effects combined, significantly favored the Boran breed for weaning weight and 18-mo weight and favored (P less than .05) the Boran breed for all other traits except birth weight. It was concluded that the Red Poll breed had higher values for additive maternal effects for birth weight than the Boran breed in the climatic and nutritive environment in which this experiment was conducted; for most other traits evaluated, the Boran breed generally had higher values for additive maternal and higher values for additive direct effects than the Red Poll breed.},

abstract = {Females vary in the size of offspring that they produce, often in a manner that depends on maternal age or stage. This is puzzling, given that offspring size is predicted to evolve to a single optimal value where the gain in fitness from being larger exactly offsets the fitness lost to the mother by producing fewer offspring. We used a stage-structured life-history model to determine the optimal offspring size for females in different stages. We found that optimal offspring size does not vary with maternal stage when offspring fitness depends only on its size and not on the stage of the mother. This negative result holds even with density dependence, when larger offspring compete better. However, a trade-off between offspring size and maternal survival affects the optimal offspring size. The future reproductive value of the female, coupled with the costs and benefits of offspring investment, drives the evolution of stage-dependent offspring size. If producing larger offspring is riskier for mothers, females produce smaller offspring when their reproductive value in the next time step is large relative to current reproductive prospects. These analyses provide a novel framework for understanding why offspring size varies in age- and stage-structured populations.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Hunting constitutes an important industry in Europe. However, data on the prevalence of vector-borne bacteria in large game animal species are lacking from several countries. Blood or spleen samples (239 and 270, respectively) were taken from red, fallow and roe deer, as well as from water buffaloes, mouflons and wild boars in Hungary, followed by DNA extraction and molecular analyses for Anaplasma phagocytophilum, haemoplasmas and rickettsiae. RESULTS Based on blood samples, the prevalence rate of A. phagocytophilum infection was significantly higher in red deer (97.9{\%}) than in fallow deer (72.7{\%}) and roe deer (60{\%}), and in all these compared to mouflons (6.3{\%}). In addition, 39.2{\%} of the spleen samples from wild boars were PCR positive for A. phagocytophilum, but none of the buffalos. Based on blood samples, the prevalence rates of both Mycoplasma wenyonii (Mw) and 'Candidatus M. haemobos' (CMh) infections were significantly higher in buffaloes (Mw: 91.2{\%}; CMh: 73.3{\%}) than in red deer (Mw: 64.6{\%}; CMh: 45.8{\%}), and in both of them compared to fallow deer (Mw: 30.3{\%}; CMh: 9.1{\%}) and roe deer (Mw: 20{\%}; CMh: 1.5{\%}). The prevalence of Mw and CMh infection significantly correlated with the body sizes of these hosts. Furthermore, Mw was significantly more prevalent than CMh in buffaloes, red and roe deer. Mycoplasma ovis was detected in mouflons, M. suis in wild boars, R. helvetica in one fallow deer and one mouflon, and an unidentified Rickettsia sp. in a fallow deer. CONCLUSIONS Forest-dwelling game animal species were found to be important carriers of A. phagocytophilum. In contrast, animals grazing grassland (i.e. buffaloes) were less likely to get infected with this Ixodes ricinus-borne pathogen. Water buffaloes, deer species, mouflons and wild boars harbored haemoplasmas that may affect domestic ungulates. Evaluated animals with larger body size had significantly higher prevalence of infection with haemoplasmas compared to smaller deer species. The above host species rarely carried rickettsiae.},

Age 0 females decreased reproductive investment prior to the onset of fall and winter months, while age 1 females increased reproductive investment as the summer progressed. The reproductive restraint and terminal investment patterns exhibited by age 0 and age 1 females, respectively, were consistent with the predictions from the cost of reproduction hypothesis. Age 0 females responded to environment-based cues, decreasing reproductive investment to increase the probability of overwinter survival and subsequent reproductive opportunities in the following summer. Age 1 females responded to age-based cues, or the proximity of death, increasing investment to current reproduction as future reproductive opportunities decreased late in life. Thus, individuals use multiple cues to determine the level of reproductive investment, and the response to each cue is dependent on the age of an individual.},

abstract = {A methodology is presented to facilitate a declaration that an area is ‘pest-free' following an eradication campaign against an insect pest. This involves probability models to assess null trapping results and also growth models to help verify, following a waiting period, that pests were not present when control was stopped. Two probability models are developed to calculate the probability of negative trapping results if in fact insects were present. If this probability is sufficiently low, then the hypothesis that insects are present is rejected. The models depend on knowledge of the efficiency and the area of attractiveness of the traps. To verify the results of the probability model, a waiting period is required to see if a re- bound occurs. If an incipient but non-detectable population remains after control measures are discontinued, then a rebound should occur. Using a growth model, the rate of increase of an insect population is examined starting from one gravid female or one male and a female. An example is given for tsetse in which both means and confidence limits are calculated for a period of 24 reproductive periods after control is terminated. If no rebound is detected, then a declaration of eradi- cation can be made.},

There are three conspicuous aspects associated with viviparity: (i) internal development is a complex trait often accompanied by a suite of secondary adaptations, yet it is unclear how the intermediate state of this trait - egg retention - could have evolved; (ii) viviparity often results in a reduction in fecundity; (iii) viviparity has evolved independently many times across a diverse array of animal groups. Focusing on the Diptera (true flies), I provide explanations for these observations. I further propose that fecundity is not traded-off to enable potential benefits of viviparity, but rather that loss of fecundity is directly selected and egg retention is an indirect consequence - a model that provides a unifying common basis for the ubiquity of viviparity.},

abstract = {Populations of laboratory animals that are selected for increased lifespan often show negative correlated responses in early fecundity. However, late fecundity and/or total lifetime fecundity can be higher in the populations selected for increased lifespan. This has been interpreted by some as being at odds with the disposable soma theory, which predicts decreased lifespan to increase total reproductive output. Alternatively, the Y–model explores the effects of variation in resource allocation and acquisition on life histories. In this model, a negative relationship between lifespan and reproduction can be viewed as variation in allocation, whereas a positive relationship is the result of variation in acquisition. However, a frequently neglected complication of the Y-model is that older individuals often show a decline in resource acquisition. Therefore, differential allocation to maintenance and survival might affect this decline in late-life acquisition which will affect resource availability across the whole lifespan. In this paper we show that a model which incorporates the ideas of the Y-model, the disposable soma theory, and an age-related decrease in resource acquisition, i.e. feeding senescence, can explain how the relationship between fecundity and lifespan changes with age. Furthermore, by modeling environments with contrasting extrinsic mortality rates, we explored how the outcome of the model depended on the relative importance of early and late-life reproduction. In high mortality environments a relatively higher early fecundity, lower late fecundity, and lower lifespans were more optimal, whereas the opposite was true for low mortality environments. We applied predictions from the model to a cohort of individually-housed female Drosophila melanogaster flies for which we measured age specific fecundity and lifespan. Early fecundity was negatively associated with lifespan, while late fecundity related positively with lifespan in the same cohort. This verified that the mechanism of feeding senescence could explain patterns for age specific relationships between lifespan and fecundity.},

Control of the endemic neglected zoonotic diseases (NZDs) would benefit from a similar campaign, which needs the support of a global community.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The resolutions from all 66 World Health Assembly (WHA) meetings held between 1948 and 2013 were examined to determine how many contain a specific focus on any of the following eight NZDs as defined by the World Health Organisation (WHO): anthrax, bovine tuberculosis (TB), brucellosis, Taenia solium cysticercosis, cystic echinococcosis (hydatidosis), leishmaniasis, rabies, and zoonotic human African trypanosomiasis (HAT or sleeping sickness). Twenty-one resolutions adopted in the 16 assemblies between 1948 and 2013 targeted one or more of these eight NZDs, representing 4{\%} of the total resolutions on infectious diseases passed to date. The 2013 adoption of Resolution WHA66.12 targeting all 17 NTDs marks a change in approach by the WHA. Whereas previous resolutions have targeted the NTDs as separate entities, the new approach of the combined resolution will help increase the overall momentum to target these ancient diseases as coendemic clusters in endemic countries. However, three major NZDs remain outside this recent resolution: anthrax, brucellosis, and bovine TB.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS AND SIGNIFICANCE: The recent adoption of a specific resolution at the WHA in 2013 that emphasises a One Health approach for the successful control of 17 NTDs is a major development in advocacy. However, recognition of the importance of three major NZDs to public health in endemic countries-anthrax, brucellosis, and bovine tuberculosis-is still lacking despite being prioritised by the WHA as early as the 1950s. Global advocacy for control of the NZDs as a whole would similarly benefit from adoption of a One Health approach as is promoted for the NTDs under WHA66.12.},

abstract = {In a recent article, Beldomenico and Begon (BB, [1]) propose that a synergy between host susceptibility and infection might potentially occur in host-pathogen interactions. They argue that hosts in poor condition are more susceptible to higher pathogen occurrence and infection intensity, which further weaken the host's condition [1]. The authors refer to the term ‘vicious circles' to illustrate this escalating process between host condition and infection level. They conclude that vicious circles are a neglected process that could influence both pathogen and host dynamics. Although we fully agree with the important ideas developed by BB, we would like to raise two additional points that we believe important to consider for further examination of vicious circles.},

abstract = {Three decades after the emergence of HIV, we have made great strides in our response to the epidemic, from prevention of transmission to testing and treatment. However, it is still common in high-prevalence settings for people to not know their HIV status, and estimates are that globally, a mere 36{\%} of those eligible for treatment are receiving it. On top of this, for every person with HIV entering treatment, two more are infected. The operational obstacles to overcoming the challenges and fully implementing proven strategies are numerous. The operational research and implementation sciences aim to provide a sound basis for how to maximize the use of limited resources by investigating the best models to deliver services and implement programmes in various settings and contexts. In this special issue, the Journal of the International AIDS Society intends to highlight some of the operational and programmatic challenges that are faced in sub-Saharan Africa, home to the largest population living with HIV. Our hope is that readers gain insight into some of the challenges associated with the HIV/AIDS epidemic and a changing environment in the region, and become familiar with some applications of operational research and implementation science in HIV healthcare settings.},

abstract = {Tsetse flies occur in much of sub-Saharan Africa where they are vectors of trypanosomes that cause human and animal African trypanosomosis. The sterile insect technique (SIT) is currently used to eliminate tsetse fly populations in an area-wide integrated pest management (AW-IPM) context in Senegal and Ethiopia. Three Glossina palpalis gambiensis strains [originating from Burkina Faso (BKF), Senegal (SEN) and an introgressed strain (SENbkf)] were established and are now available for use in future AW-IPM programmes against trypanosomes in West Africa. For each strain, knowledge of the environmental survival thresholds is essential to determine which of these strains is best suited to a particular environment or ecosystem, and can therefore be used effectively in SIT programmes. In this paper, we investigated the survival and fecundity of three G. p. gambiensis strains maintained under various conditions: 25 °C and 40, 50, 60, and 75 {\%} relative humidity (rH), 30 °C and 60 {\%} rH and 35 °C and 60 {\%} rH. The survival of the three strains was dependent on temperature only, and it was unaffected by changing humidity within the tested range. The BKF strain survived temperatures above its optimum better than the SEN strain. The SENbkf showed intermediate resistance to high temperatures. A temperature of about 32 °C was the limit for survival for all strains. A rH ranging from 40 to 76 {\%} had no effect on fecundity at 25–26 °C. We discuss the implications of these results on tsetse SIT-based control programmes.},

abstract = {Displacement rates of tsetse affect performance of targets during vector control. Fly size, one of the indicators of population structure usually obtained from wing measurement, is among the determinants of displacement rates. Although recovery of tsetse in previous intervention areas has been widely reported, the population structure of tsetse that recover is rarely evaluated despite being associated with displacements rates. Previously, intervention trials had reduced tsetse densities by over 90{\%} from {\textgreater}3 flies/trap/day to {\textless}1fly/trap/day on Big Chamaunga and Manga islands of Lake Victoria in western Kenya. In this study, we assessed the recovery in densities of Glossina fuscipes fuscipes on the two islands and evaluated the effects vector control might have on the population structure. A before and after intervention study was undertaken on four islands of Lake Victoria in western Kenya; Small and Big Chamaunga, Manga and Rusinga Islands, two of which tsetse control intervention had previously been undertaken. Three years after intervention average G. f. fuscipes catches in biconical traps were estimated on each island. Wing centroid size (CS) (a measurement of fly size) and shape, indicators of the population structure of flies from the four islands were compared using geometric morphometric analyses. CS and shape of available female but not male tsetse wings obtained before the intervention trial on Big and Small Chamaunga islands were compared with those from the same islands after the intervention trial. G. f. fuscipes apparent density on the previous intervention islands were{\textgreater}9 flies/trap/day. Irrespective of sex, wing shape did not isolate tsetse based on their islands of origin. The fly size from Big and Small Chamaunga did not differ significantly before intervention trials (P = 0.728). However, three years after the intervention flies from Big Chamaunga were significantly smaller than those from Small Chamaunga (P {\textless} 0.003). Further, there was an increase in the divergence of wing morphology between flies collected from Big Chamaunga and those from Small Chamaunga after tsetse control. In conclusion, even though populations are not isolated, vector control could influence the population structure of tsetse by exerting size and wing morphology differential selection pressures. Therefore, we recommend further studies to understand the mechanism behind this as it may guide future vector control strategies.},

abstract = {The coexistence of ecologically similar species (i.e. species utilizing the same resource) is a major topic in ecology. Communities are assembled either through the biotic interactions of ecologically similar species, e.g. competition, or by the abiotic separation of species along gradients of environmental conditions. Here, we investigated the temporal segregation, succession and seasonality of dung-inhabiting Coleoptera and Diptera that utilize an identical resource in exactly the same way. The data were collected from two temperate pastures, one in the United Kingdom and the second in the Czech Republic. There was no evident temporal separation between ecologically similar coleopterous or dipterous taxa during succession. In contrast, these two orders were almost perfectly separated seasonally in both combined and site-specific datasets. Flies were most abundant in the summer, and beetles were more abundant in the spring and autumn. Ecologically similar beetles and flies also displayed seasonal separation in both combined and site-specific data. Analyses within site-specific data sets revealed such a separation at both the order and species level. Season is therefore the main temporal axis separating ecologically similar species of dung-inhabiting insects in temperate habitats, while succession aggregates species that may have similar environmental tolerances (to e.g. dung moisture). This separation between ecologically similar taxa of beetles and flies may be attributable to either competition-based niche separation or to temperature tolerance-based habitat filtering, since flies have peak activity in warmer months while beetles have peak activity in cooler months.},

The model predicts the proportion of insects in a population in various stages of development as a stochastic function of accumulated degree - days . The model is based on a logistic probability distribution with mean and variance changing through time . Maximum likelihood parameters of the estimates are easily computed with nonlinear regression pack - ages . Appropriate statistical tests are presented for comparing models . Results should be useful to researchers and biological modelers who describe insect or plant phenology . PREDICTINGTHE OCCURRENCEof developmental stages is important to insect population modeling . Because economic damage is often heaviest during a certain stage, forest or agricultural losses can be better predicted when the onset of that stage is known . Factors regulating population size , such as predation , food limitation , and weather , affect de - velopmental stages differently . An insect popula - tion can also respond differently to pest control methods applied to different stages of the popu - lation ' s life cycle . Information on developing field populations is often variable . A sample may contain insects in several developmental stages , and the relative pro - portions of each stage may change when new sam - ples are drawn . Predicting variability through time is an important component of modeling because it allows calculation of the economic risk associated with various developmental stages . Incorporating variability into insect population models is crucial but difficult . The stochastic vari - ation should be included in a way that has biolog - ical meaning . Unfortunately , adding stochastic ef - fects rapidly increases the complexity of the model , making it harder to use . Methods for estimating parameters and testing the model must be clear and easy to perform for the model to be practical . Stochastic modeling is often misunderstood ; in - vestigators build expensive models containing sto - chastic information but discard it and in the end concentrate on the mean behavior of the system .

abstract = {Insect water balance plays an important role in determining energy budgets, activity patterns, survival, and population dynamics and, hence, geographic distribution. Tsetse (Glossina spp.) are important vectors of human and animal disease occupying a wide range of habitats in Africa and are notable for their desiccation resistance in xeric environments. Here, we measure water balance and related traits [water loss rate (WLR), body water content (BWC), body lipid content (BLC) and body mass] in adult flies across a range of temperature (20-30°C) and relative humidity (0-99{\%}) combinations in four tsetse species from both xeric and mesic habitats. WLRs were significantly affected by measurement under different temperature and relative humidity combinations, while BWC, BLC, and body mass were less affected. These results provide support for mass-independent inter- and intra-specific variation in WLRs and survival times. Furthermore, water balance responses to variation in temperature and relative humidity are complex in Glossina, and this response varies within and among species, subgroups, and ecotypes in terms of both magnitude of effects and the direction of change. Different effects of temperature and relative humidity within and among experimental conditions and species suggests cuticular permeability and saturation deficit are likely to be key factors in forecasting tsetse water balance responses to climate variability. This complicates potential forecasting of tsetse distribution in the face of climate change. {\textcopyright} 2011 Kleynhans and Terblanche.},

An increase of temperature to 36 deg C produced no further effect. The time course of frequency changes was affected in a complex manner by temperature, due probably to the interaction of a number of physico-chemical and behavioural processes with different temperature dependencies. Higher temperatures caused a more rapid overall decline in wingbeat frequency, consistent with the greater demand on the limited reserve of the only important flight substrate, proline. At 20 deg C, a considerable proportion of flies were relatively inactive, whilst a small proportion flew for longer than at any other temperature. At intermediate temperatures, both extremes in flight duration decreased, but at 36 deg C, 80{\%} of males flew for less than 90 s. These observations can be explained on the basis of the interaction between the tendency of tsetse to be inactive at extremes of temperature and the more rapid oxidation of reserves at higher temperatures},

abstract = {We have previously documented multiple, independent origins of placentas in the fish family Poeciliidae. Here we summarize similar analyses of fishes in the family Zenarchopteridae. This family includes three live-bearing genera. Earlier studies documented the presence of superfetation, or the ability to carry multiple litters of young in different stages of development in the same ovary, in some species in all three genera. There is also one earlier report of matrotrophy, or extensive postfertilization maternal provisioning, in two of these genera. We present detailed life-history data for approximately half of the species in all three genera and combine them with the best available phylogeny to make inferences about the pattern of life-history evolution within this family. Three species of Hemirhamphodon have superfetation but lack matrotrophy. Most species in Nomorhamphus and Dermogenys either lack superfetation and matrotrophy or have both superfetation and matrotrophy. Our phylogenetic analysis shows that matrotrophy may have evolved independently in each genus. In Dermogenys, matrotrophic species produce fewer, larger offspring than nonmatrotrophic species. In Nomorhamphus; matrotrophic species instead produce more and smaller offspring than lecithotrophic species. However, the matrotrophic species in both genera have significantly smaller masses of reproductive tissue relative to their body sizes. All aspects of these results are duplicated in the fish family Poeciliidae. We discuss the possible adaptive significance of matrotrophy in the light of these new results. The two families together present a remarkable opportunity to study the evolution of a complex trait because they contain multiple, independent origins of the trait that often include close relatives that vary in either the presence or absence of the matrotrophy or in the degree to which matrotrophy is developed. These are the raw materials that are required for either an analysis of the adaptive significance of the trait or for studies of the genetic mechanisms that underlie the evolution of the trait.},

The numbers of tsetse electrocuted in flight near the base of the trunk increased 2-12 times when the trunk was shortened from 7.2 m to 0.9m and its diameter was increased from 25 cm to 5 m, when the base was coloured blue or black to contrast with the upper trunk, or when the upper trunk was separated from the base by a gap of 2.7 m. A swarm flying near short trunks was more compact than near tall trunks. Electrocuting grids to catch alighting tsetse indicated that only about 20{\%} of the attracted tsetse alighted on the base of the trunk, whether this was blue or blue/black. Since there is presently no apparent means of cost-effectively avoiding the inhibitory effects of tall trunks, the use of odour-baited trees as baits for tsetse control seems uneconomical.

abstract = {We perform sensitivity analyses on a mathematical model of malaria transmission to determine the relative importance of model parameters to disease transmission and prevalence. We compile two sets of baseline parameter values: one for areas of high transmission and one for low transmission. We compute sensitivity indices of the reproductive number (which measures initial disease transmission) and the endemic equilibrium point (which measures disease prevalence) to the parameters at the baseline values. We find that in areas of low transmission, the reproductive number and the equilibrium proportion of infectious humans are most sensitive to the mosquito biting rate. In areas of high transmission, the reproductive number is again most sensitive to the mosquito biting rate, but the equilibrium proportion of infectious humans is most sensitive to the human recovery rate. This suggests strategies that target the mosquito biting rate (such as the use of insecticide-treated bed nets and indoor residual spraying) and those that target the human recovery rate (such as the prompt diagnosis and treatment of infectious individuals) can be successful in controlling malaria.},

abstract = {Morphometrics underwent a revolution more than one decade ago. In the modern morphometrics, the estimate of size is now contained in a single variable reflecting variation in many directions, as many as there are landmarks under study, and shape is defined as their relative positions after correcting for size, position and orientation. With these informative data, and the corresponding software freely available to conduct complex analyses, significant biological and epidemiological features can be quantified more accurately. We discuss the evolutionary significance of the environmental impact on metric variability, mentioning the importance of concepts like genetic assimilation, genetic accommodation, and epigenetics. We provide examples of measuring the effect of selection on metric variation by comparing (unpublished) Qst values with corresponding (published) Fst. The primary needs of medical entomologists are to distinguish species, especially cryptic species, and to detect them where they are not expected. We explain how geometric morphometrics could apply to these questions, and where there are deficiencies preventing the approach from being utilized at its maximum potential. Medical entomologists in connection with control programs aim to identify isolated populations where the risk of reinfestation after treatment would be low ("biogeographical islands"). Identifying them can be obtained from estimating the number of migrants per generation. Direct assessment of movement remains the most valid approach, but it scores active movement only. Genetic methods estimating gene flow levels among interbreeding populations are commonly used, but gene flow does not necessarily mean the current flow of migrants. Methods using the morphometric variation are neither suited to evaluate gene flow, nor are they adapted to estimate the flow of migrants. They may provide, however, the information needed to create a preliminary map pointing to relevant areas where one could invest in using molecular machinery. In case of reinfesting specimens after treatment, the question relates to the likely source of reinfesting specimens: are they a residual sample not affected by the control measures, or are they individuals migrating from surrounding, untreated foci? We explain why the morphometric approach may be adapted to answer such question. Thus, we describe the differences between estimating the flow of migrants and identifying the source of reinfestation after treatment: although morphometrics is not suited to deal with the former, it may be an appropriate tool to address the latter. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {R. Laxminarayan, 9 S. I. Hay, 3 ,5 D. L. Smith 3 ,6 ,7, 9 * Eradication may not be necessary before countries can eliminate, scale back control, and rely on health systems. W hen the Global Malaria Eradication Programme (GMEP) was launched in 1955 (1, 2), all malaria-endemic countries outside of Africa were (or would soon be) eliminating malaria (3). The GMEP's design was based on a theory of malaria transmission dynamics and control that has become the standard for malaria elimination decisions today (4– 6). When fi nancial support for the GMEP collapsed in 1969, participat-ing countries were caught at different stages of progress toward elimination (1). Examin-ing their fate in the decades that followed pro-vides a natural experiment that tests the the-ory. With a rise in funding (7) and renewed interest in eradication (8, 9), there is now a need to revisit the lessons learned from the GMEP. We identify changes in the epidemi-ology of malaria when elimination is reached that could explain its stability and discuss how this calls for a reassessment of strategies for eradication. Standard Theory of Malaria Elimination Malaria elimination involves stopping trans-mission in a defi ned region until no parasites remain (6, 10), through implementation of vector control, treatment of infected individu-als, and other available interventions. Eradica-tion is elimination at a global scale. Between 1945 and 2010, 79 countries eliminated malaria and 75 (95{\%}) remained malaria-free (11), which shrank the geographical range of malaria (12). A recent review identified 75 resurgent malaria transmission events in 61 countries (13), which included marked increases in malaria incidence in 36 of the 49 countries (73{\%}) that had participated in the GMEP but had failed to reach elimination (11, 14). Resurgent malaria after the GMEP con-fi rms some predictions of the standard theory, but elsewhere, the apparent stability of elim-ination is counterintuitive and may require a reappraisal of the theory. It suggests that elim-ination could be a way to solve the Sisyphean problem of malaria (15). Standard theory for malaria elimination is based on a threshold concept called R 0 (4, 5), the expected number of secondary infec-tions produced by each infected human in the absence of control or acquired immunity. R 0 is a threshold condition because each case must cause at least one other case to have sustained},

Presently, the extraction of landmarks is usually done manually and the process of identifying the landmarks is an important and labour-intensive part of any such analysis. This process is time-consuming, and quite often the research questions are dependent on the duration of obtaining these data. The authors show that a single training image with its landmark co-ordinates is enough to independently estimate the landmarks of any individual within a particular data set. The reliability and accuracy of the method can be further enhanced by using multiple training images. The precision, repeatability and robustness of the algorithm have been evaluated. It is shown in this study that the method is sufficiently accurate to replace the manual identification of landmarks. The generic nature and intrinsic capability of the feature recognition process enables this method to be easily incorporated into other recognition tasks.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Lord et al. Females of all blood-feeding arthropod vectors must find and feed on a host in order to produce offspring. For tsetse—vectors of the trypanosomes that cause human and animal African trypanosomiasis—the problem is more extreme, since both sexes feed solely on blood. Host location is thus essential both for survival and reproduction. Host population density should therefore be an important driver of population dynamics for haematophagous insects, and particularly for tsetse, but the role of host density is poorly understood. We investigate the issue using data on changes in numbers of tsetse (Glossina morsitans morsitans Westwood) caught during a host elimination experiment in Zimbabwe in the 1960s. During the experiment, numbers of flies caught declined by 95{\%}. We aimed to assess whether models including starvation-dependent mortality could explain observed changes in tsetse numbers as host density declined. An ordinary differential equation model, including starvation-dependent mortality, captured the initial dynamics of the observed tsetse population. However, whereas small numbers of tsetse were caught throughout the host elimination exercise, the modelled population went extinct. Results of a spatially explicit agent-based model suggest that this discrepancy could be explained by immigration of tsetse into the experimental plot. Variation in host density, as a result of natural and anthropogenic factors, may influence tsetse population dynamics in space and time. This has implications for Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense transmission. Increased tsetse mortality as a consequence of low host density may decrease trypanosome transmission, but hungrier flies may be more inclined to bite humans, thereby increasing the risk of transmission to humans. Our model provides a way of exploring the role of host density on tsetse population dynamics and could be incorporated into models of trypanosome transmission dynamics to better understand how spatio-temporal variation in host density impacts trypanosome prevalence in mammalian hosts.},

abstract = {Sphingosine is a structural component of sphingolipids. The metabolism of phosphoethanolamine ceramide (sphingomyelin) by sphingomyelinase (SMase), followed by the breakdown of ceramide by ceramidase (CDase) yields sphingosine. Female tsetse fly is viviparous and generates a single progeny within her uterus during each gonotrophic cycle. The mother provides her offspring with nutrients required for development solely via intrauterine lactation. Quantitative PCR showed that acid smase1 (asmase1) increases in mother's milk gland during lactation. aSMase1 was detected in the milk gland and larval gut, indicating this protein is generated during lactation and consumed by the larva. The higher levels of SMase activity in larval gut contents indicate that this enzyme is activated by the low gut pH. In addition, cdase is expressed at high levels in the larval gut. Breakdown of the resulting ceramide is likely accomplished by the larval gut-secreted CDase, which allows absorption of sphingosine. We used the tsetse system to understand the critical role(s) of SMase and CDase during pregnancy and lactation and their downstream effects on adult progeny fitness. Reduction of asmase1 by short interfering RNA negatively impacted pregnancy and progeny performance, resulting in a 4-5-day extension in pregnancy, 10{\%}-15{\%} reduction in pupal mass, lower pupal hatch rates, impaired heat tolerance, reduced symbiont levels, and reduced fecundity of adult progeny. This study suggests that the SMase activity associated with tsetse lactation and larval digestion is similar in function to that of mammalian lactation and represents a critical process for juvenile development, with important effects on the health of progeny during their adulthood.},

One of the most economical and effective methods of tsetse control is the use of insecticide-treated screens, called targets, that simulate hosts. Targets have been {\~{}}1 m2, but recently it was shown that those tsetse that occupy riverine situations, and which are the main vectors of sleeping sickness, respond well to targets only {\~{}}0.06 m2. The cheapness of these tiny targets suggests the need to reconsider what intensity and duration of target deployments comprise the most cost-effective strategy in various riverine habitats.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A deterministic model, written in Excel spreadsheets and managed by Visual Basic for Applications, simulated the births, deaths and movement of tsetse confined to a strip of riverine vegetation composed of segments of habitat in which the tsetse population was either self-sustaining, or not sustainable unless supplemented by immigrants. Results suggested that in many situations the use of tiny targets at high density for just a few months per year would be the most cost-effective strategy for rapidly reducing tsetse densities by the {\~{}}90{\%} expected to have a great impact on the incidence of sleeping sickness. Local elimination of tsetse becomes feasible when targets are deployed in isolated situations, or where the only invasion occurs from populations that are not self-sustaining.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: Seasonal use of tiny targets deserves field trials. The ability to recognise habitat that contains tsetse populations which are not self-sustaining could improve the planning of all methods of tsetse control, against any species, in riverine, savannah or forest situations.

abstract = {Trypanosoma congolense and Trypanosoma vivax are major species that infect cattle in north-eastern KwaZulu-Natal (KZN), South Africa. Of the two genetically distinct types of T. congolense, Savannah and Kilifi sub-groups, isolated from cattle and tsetse flies in KZN, the former is more prevalent and thought to be responsible for African animal trypanosomosis outbreaks in cattle. Furthermore, variation in pathogenicity within the Savannah sub-group is ascribed to strain differences and seems to be related to geographical locations. The objective of the present study was to compare the virulence of T. congolense strains isolated from African buffaloes (Syncerus caffer) inside Hluhluwe-iMfolozi Park, and from cattle on farms near wildlife parks ({\textless} 5 km), to isolates from cattle kept away ({\textgreater} 10 km) from parks. To obtain T. congolense isolates, blood of known parasitologically positive cattle or cattle symptomatically suspect with trypanosomosis, as well as isolates from buffaloes kept inside Hluhluwe-iMfolozi Park were passaged in inbred BALB/c mice. A total of 26 T. congolense isolates were obtained: 5 from buffaloes, 13 from cattle kept near parks and 8 from cattle distant from parks. Molecular characterisation revealed 80{\%} and 20{\%} of isolates to belong to T. congolense Savannah and Kilifi, respectively. To compare virulence, each isolate was inoculated into a group of six mice. No statistical differences were observed in the mean pre-patent period, maximum parasitaemia or drop in packed cell volume (PCV). Significant differences were found in days after infection for the drop in PCV, the patent period and the survival time. These differences were used to categorise the isolates as being of high, moderate or low virulence. Based on the virulence, 12 of 26 (46{\%}) isolates were classified as highly virulent and 27{\%} each as either of moderate or of low virulence. Whilst 11 of 12 high virulent strains were from buffaloes or cattle near the park, only 1 of 7 low virulent strains was from these animals. All the Kilifi T. congolense types were less virulent than the Savannah types. These results confirmed the higher virulence of T. congolense Savannah type compared to Kilifi type and indicated the prevalence of highly virulent strains to be higher in wildlife parks and in cattle near the parks than on farms further away. The geographical location of these strains in relation to the wildlife parks in the area was discussed.},

abstract = {A mathematical model for endemic malaria involving variable hu- man and mosquito populations is analysed. A threshold parameter R0 exists and the disease can persist if and only if R0 exceeds 1. R0 is seen to be a gen- eralisation of the basic reproduction ratio associated with the Ross-Macdonald model for malaria transmission. The disease free equilibrium always exist and is globally stable when R0 is below 1. A perturbation analysis is used to ap- proximate the endemic equilibrium in the important case where the disease related death rate is nonzero, small but significant. A diffusion approximation is used to approximate the quasi-stationary distribution of the associated sto- chastic model. Numerical simulations show that when R0 is distinctly greater than 1, the endemic deterministic equilibrium is globally stable. Further- more, in quasi-stationarity, the stochastic process undergoes oscillations about a mean population whose size can be approximated by the stable endemic deterministic equilibrium.},

abstract = {Females vary in the size of offspring that they produce, often in a manner that depends on maternal age or stage. This is puzzling, given that offspring size is predicted to evolve to a single optimal value where the gain in fitness from being larger exactly offsets the fitness lost to the mother by producing fewer offspring. We used a stage-structured life-history model to determine the optimal offspring size for females in different stages. We found that optimal offspring size does not vary with maternal stage when offspring fitness depends only on its size and not on the stage of the mother. This negative result holds even with density dependence, when larger offspring compete better. However, a trade-off between offspring size and maternal survival affects the optimal offspring size. The future reproductive value of the female, coupled with the costs and benefits of offspring investment, drives the evolution of stage-dependent offspring size. If producing larger offspring is riskier for mothers, females produce smaller offspring when their reproductive value in the next time step is large relative to current reproductive prospects. These analyses provide a novel framework for understanding why offspring size varies in age- and stage-structured populations.},

In the blue-footed booby, Sula nebouxii, a long-lived bird, after initial increase, male reproductive success declines progressively with age. Before laying, males of two age classes were challenged with lipopolysaccharide to elicit an immune response, which induced symptoms of declining survival prospects. Reproductive success of immune-challenged mature males fell, while that of immune-challenged old males showed a 98{\%} increase. These results demonstrate that senescent males with poor reproductive prospects increase their effort when those prospects are threatened, whereas younger males with good reproductive prospects do not.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Sleeping sickness, also called human African trypanosomiasis, is transmitted by the tsetse, a blood-sucking fly confined to sub-Saharan Africa. The form of the disease in West and Central Africa is carried mainly by species of tsetse that inhabit riverine woodland and feed avidly on humans. In contrast, the vectors for the East and Southern African form of the disease are usually savannah species that feed mostly on wild and domestic animals and bite humans infrequently, mainly because the odours produced by humans can be repellent. Hence, it takes a long time to catch many savannah tsetse from people, which in turn means that studies of the nature of contact between savannah tsetse and humans, and the ways of minimizing it, have been largely neglected.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The savannah tsetse, Glossina morsitans morsitans and G. pallidipes, were caught from men in the Mana Pools National park of Zimbabwe. Mostly the catch consisted of young G. m. morsitans, with little food reserve. Catches were increased by 4-8 times if the men were walking, not stationary, and increased about ten times more if they rode on a truck at 10 km/h. Catches were unaffected if the men used deodorant or were baited with artificial ox odour, but declined by about 95{\%} if the men were with an ox. Surprisingly, men pursuing their normal daily activities were bitten about as much when in or near buildings as when in woodland. Catches from oxen and a standard ox-like trap were poor indices of the number and physiological state of tsetse attacking men.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: The search for new strategies to minimize the contact between humans and savannah tsetse should focus on that occurring in buildings and vehicles. There is a need to design a man-like trap to help to provide an index of sleeping sickness risk.},

abstract = {A density-dependent model is used to describe the dynamics of an open population of tsetse flies (Diptera: Glossinidae). Immigration (or emigration) takes place when the total population is below (or above) a biologically determined threshold value. The population is also subjected to birth and death rates, as well as to the risk of being trapped (continuously or intermittently). During trapping the population decreases toward a 'low' equilibrium population and when trapping ceases the population starts recovering and increases toward a 'high' equilibrium. The model is fitted using data collected on trapped flies in four experiments. The first one was conducted with 'intermittent trapping' (i.e. several trapping-recovery cycles) on Glossina fuscipes fuscipes Newstead in the Central African Republic (Bangui area). In the other experiments, trapping data on Glossina palpalis palpalis (Robineau-Desvoidy) was collected in 'aggregate' form over several days at a time. Two of these were in Congo-Brazzaville (Bouenza area) and one in the Ivory Coast (Vavoua focus). Estimates are derived for the low and high equilibrium values as well as the trapping rate. The estimated effect of sustained trapping is to reduce the population to low equilibrium values that are 85-87{\%} lower than the levels without trapping. The effects of the natural intrinsic growth and of the migration flows cannot be estimated separately because in the model they are mathematically indistinguishable.},

Movement behaviour data collected automatically using these sensors over prolonged periods of time could be of use to stakeholders making man-agement and disease control decisions in rural sub-Saharan Africa leading to potential improvements in animal health and production. Motion sensors were used in this study with the aim of monitoring and quantifying the movement behaviour of traditionally managed Angoni cattle in Petauke District in the Eastern Province of Zambia. This study was designed to assess whether motion sensors were suitable for use on traditionally managed cattle in two veterinary camps in Petauke District in the Eastern Province of Zambia. In each veterinary camp, twenty cattle were selected for study. Each animal had a motion sensor placed on its hind leg to continuously measure and record its movement behaviour over a two week period. Analysing the sensor data using principal components analysis (PCA) revealed that the majority of variability in behaviour among studied cattle could be attributed to their behaviour at night and in the morning. The behaviour at night was markedly different between veterinary camps; while differences in the morning appeared to reflect varying behaviour across all animals. The study results validate the use of such motion sensors in the chosen setting and highlight the importance of appropriate data summarisation tech-niques to adequately describe and compare animal movement behaviours if association to other factors, such as location, breed or health status are to be assessed.},

Medical surveys were performed in both areas in 2012 and 2013.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nFINDINGS: In the vector control area, there was an 80{\%} decrease in tsetse density, resulting in a significant decrease of human tsetse contacts, and a decrease of disease prevalence (from 0.3{\%} to 0.1{\%}; p=0.01), and an almost nil incidence of new infections ({\textless}0.1{\%}). In contrast, incidence was 10 times higher in the area without vector control ({\textgreater}1{\%}, p{\textless}0.0001) with a disease prevalence increasing slightly (from 0.5 to 0.7{\%}, p=0.34).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nINTERPRETATION: Combining medical and vector control was decisive in reducing T. b. gambiense transmission and in speeding up progress towards elimination.

Therefore, we analyzed longitudinal plasma samples from 40 patients enrolled in the Abbott M97-720 trial at baseline (pretherapy) and weeks 60 to 384 by using an HIV-1 RNA assay with single-copy sensitivity. All patients were on therapy (lopinavir/ritonavir, stavudine, and lamivudine) with plasma HIV RNA {\textless}50 copies per ml by week 96 of the study and thereafter. Single-copy assay results revealed that 77{\%} of the patient samples had detectable low-level viremia ({\textgreater}/=1 copy per ml), and all patients had at least one sample with detectable viremia. A nonlinear mixed effects model revealed a biphasic decline in plasma RNA levels occurring over weeks 60 to 384: an initial phase of decay with a half-life of 39 weeks and a subsequent phase with no perceptible decay. The level of pretherapy viremia extrapolated for each phase of decay was significantly correlated with total baseline viremia for each patient (R(2) = 0.27, P = 0.001 and R(2) = 0.19, P {\textless} 0.005, respectively), supporting a biological link between the extent of overall baseline viral infection and the infection of long-lived reservoirs. These data suggest that low-level persistent viremia appears to arise from at least two cell compartments, one in which viral production decays over time and a second in which viral production remains stable for at least 7 years.},

abstract = {A common assumption about malaria, dengue, and other mosquito-borne infections is that the two main components of the risk of human infection--the rate at which people are bitten (human biting rate) and the proportion of mosquitoes that are infectious--are positively correlated. In fact, these two risk factors are generated by different processes and may be negatively correlated across space and time in heterogeneous environments. Uneven distribution of blood-meal hosts and larval habitat creates a spatial mosaic of demograPhic sources and sinks. Moreover, mosquito populations fluctuate temporally, forced by environmental variables such as rainfall, temperature, and humidity. These sources of spatial and temporal heterogeneity in the distribution of mosquito populations generate variability in the human biting rate, in the proportion of mosquitoes that are infectious, and in the risk of human infection. To understand how heterogeneity affects the epidemiology of mosquito-borne infections, we developed a set of simple models that incorporate heterogeneity in a stepwise fashion. These models predict that the human biting rate is highest shortly after the mosquito densities peak, near breeding sites where adult mosquitoes emerge, and around the edges of areas where humans are aggregated. In contrast, the proportion of mosquitoes that are infectious reflects the age structure of mosquito populations; it peaks where old mosquitoes are found, far from mosquito breeding habitat, and when mosquito population density is declining. Finally, we show that estimates for the average risk of infection that are based on the average entomological inoculation rate are strongly biased in heterogeneous environments.},

abstract = {A matrix model is used to describe the dynamics of a population of female tsetse flies structured by parity (i.e., by the number of larvae laid). For typical parameter values, the intrinsic growth rate of the population is zero when the adult daily survival rate is 0.970, corresponding to an adult life expectancy of 1/0.030 = 33.3 days. This value is plausible and consistent with results found earlier by others. The intrinsic growth rate is insensitive to the variance of the interlarval period. Temperature being a function of the time of the year, a known relationship between temperature and mean pupal and interlarval times was used to produce a time-varying version of the model which was fitted to temperature and (estimated) population data. With well-chosen parameter values, the modeled population replicated at least roughly the population data. This illustrates dynamically the abiotic effect of temperature on population growth. Given that tsetse flies are the vectors of trypanosomiasis ("sleeping sickness") the model provides a framework within which future transmission models can be developed in order to study the impact of altered temperatures on the spread of this deadly disease. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: African trypansomiases of humans and animals can be controlled by attacking the vectors, various species of tsetse fly. Treatment of cattle with pyrethroids to kill tsetse as they feed is the most cost-effective method. However, such treatments can contaminate cattle dung, thereby killing the fauna which disperse the dung and so play an important role in soil fertility. Hence there is a need to identify cost-effective methods of treating cattle with minimal impact on dung fauna.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We used dung beetles to field bioassay the levels of dung contamination following the use of spray and pour-on formulations of deltamethrin, applied to various parts of the body of cattle in Zimbabwe. Results suggested that dung was contaminated by contact with insecticide on the body surface as the cattle defecated, and by ingestion of insecticide as the cattle licked themselves. Death of dung beetles was reduced to negligible levels by using only the spray and applying it to the legs and belly or legs alone, i.e., places where most tsetse feed.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: The restricted applications suitable for minimising the impact on dung fauna have the collateral benefits of improving the economy and convenience of cattle treatments for tsetse control. The demonstration of collateral benefits is one of the surest ways of promoting environmentally friendly procedures.},

abstract = {Glossina brevipalpis and G. austeni are the vectors of nagana in cattle in N.E. KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Before intervention through target technology could be applied successfully to control these species, studies were needed on the two species' attraction to host odours, trapping, dispersal, feeding responses and their distribution. Studies with host odours, to find an attractive odour for G. austeni, proved that CO2 was the main attractive component for this species. The existing chemicals of the best SA odour remained to be the main attractive components for G. brevipalpis. A bicoloured electric-blue/black XT was refined to use in distribution surveys. The newly developed H trap was effective in catching relatively high numbers of both species. This trap was applied in population dispersal studies in that live tsetse could be captured for mark-release-recapture trials. These studies revealed that target densities for G. brevipalpis and G. austeni of about 4 and 7 targets/km2, respectively, should be effective for their successful control with odour-baited insecticide-impregnated targets.  G. austeni was confined to densely shaded areas but it traversed short distances of up to 345 m of “unsuitable” habitat between pockets of vegetation. G. brevipalpis was considered a much more mobile fly and traversed wide areas of 1,345 m. Both species were readily attracted to cattle, but not to goats nor bushpig. They also fed more readily on cattle and would also feed at night. It was recommended that cattle could be applied as mobile targets to control both species in areas where cattle predominate.    Tsetse surveys showed that there were two distinct bands of distribution for G. brevipalpis. The main sources of this species were the game reserves and other natural areas. G. austeni had a more widespread north to south distribution. A Geographic Information System was used to map tsetse distribution and their apparent densities. This was collated with trypanosomosis incidence and prevalence, diptank distribution, land tenure/designation, landcover and vegetation types. Finally, a strategy was proposed for the monitoring and sustainable integrated control and eventual eradication of both tsetse species. With this proposed strategy eradication could be achieved within 8–12 years.},

Adult longevity of flies reared at 25 degrees C was slightly greater than that of flies raised at 20 or 29 degrees C when measured at all three temperatures. This may reflect the laboratory history of the strain. On the whole, it appeared that longevity was independent of adult body size. These results support our previous conclusion (Zwaan et al., 1991) that developmental time and body size are not causally related to longevity in 'environmental' studies.

abstract = {Body size is a key feature of organisms and varies continuously because of the effects of natural selection on the size-dependency of resource acquisition and mortality rates. This review provides a critical and synthetic overview of body size variation in insects from a predominantly macroecological (large-scale temporal and spatial) perspective. Because of the importance of understanding the proximate determinants of adult size, it commences with a brief summary of the physiological mechanisms underlying adult body size and its variation, based mostly on findings for the model species Drosophila melanogaster and Manduca sexta. Variation in nutrition and temperature have variable effects on critical weight, the interval to cessation of growth (or terminal growth period) and growth rates, so influencing final adult size. Ontogenetic and phylogenetic variation in size, compensatory growth, scaling at the intra-and interspecific levels, sexual size dimorphism, and body size optimisation are then reviewed in light of their influences on individual and species body size frequency distributions. Explicit attention is given to evolutionary trends, including gigantism, Cope's rule and the rates at which size change has taken place, and to temporal ecological trends such as variation in size with succession and size-selectivity during the invasion process. Large-scale spatial variation in size at the intraspecific, interspecific and assemblage levels is considered, with special attention being given to the mechanisms proposed to underlie clinal variation in adult body size. Finally, areas particularly in need of additional research are identified.},

abstract = {Studies were carried out in Zimbabwe of the responses of tsetse to cattle treated with deltamethrin applied to the parts of the body where most tsetse were shown to land. Large proportions of Glossina pallidipes Austen (Diptera: Glossinidae) landed on the belly ( approximately 25{\%}) and legs ( approximately 70{\%}), particularly the front legs ( approximately 50{\%}). Substantial proportions of Glossina morsitans morsitans Westwood landed on the legs ( approximately 50{\%}) and belly (25{\%}), with the remainder landing on the torso, particularly the flanks ( approximately 15{\%}). Studies were made of the knockdown rate of wild, female G. pallidipes exposed to cattle treated with a 1{\%} pour-on or 0.005{\%} suspension concentrate of deltamethrin applied to the (a) whole body, (b) belly and legs, (c) legs, (d) front legs, (e) middle and lower front legs, or (f) lower front legs. The restricted treatments used 20{\%}, 10{\%}, 5{\%}, 2{\%} or 1{\%} of the active ingredient applied in the whole-body treatments. There was a marked seasonal effect on the performance of all treatments. With the whole-body treatment, the persistence period (knockdown {\textgreater} 50{\%}) ranged from approximately 10 days during the hot, wet season (mean daily temperature {\textgreater} 30 degrees C) to approximately 20 days during the cool, dry season ({\textless} 22 degrees C). Restricting the application of insecticide reduced the seasonal persistence periods to approximately 10-15 days if only the legs and belly were treated, approximately 5-15 days if only the legs were treated and {\textless} 5 days for the more restricted treatments. The restricted application did not affect the landing distribution of tsetse or the duration of landing bouts (mean = 30 s). The results suggest that more cost-effective control of tsetse could be achieved by applying insecticide to the belly and legs of cattle at 2-week intervals, rather than using the current practice of treating the whole body of each animal at monthly intervals. This would cut the cost of insecticide by 40{\%}, improve efficacy by 27{\%} and reduce the threats to non-target organisms and the enzootic stability of tick-borne diseases.},

abstract = {Long-lived iteroparous species often show aging-related changes in reproduction that may be explained by 2 non-mutually exclusive hypotheses. The terminal investment hypothesis predicts increased female reproductive effort toward the end of the life span, as individuals have little to gain by reserving effort for the future. The senescence hypothesis predicts decreased female reproductive output toward the end of the life span due to an age-related decline in body condition. Nonhuman primates are ideal organisms for testing these hypotheses, as they are long lived and produce altricial offspring heavily dependent on maternal investment. In this study, we integrated 50 years of continuous demographic records for the Cayo Santiago rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta) population with new morphometric and behavioral data to test the senescence and terminal investment hypotheses. We examined relationships between maternal age and activity, mother and infant body condition, interbirth intervals, measures of behavioral investment in offspring, and offspring survival and fitness to test for age-associated declines in reproduction that would indicate senescence, and for age-associated increases in maternal effort that would indicate terminal investment. Compared with younger mothers, older mothers had lower body mass indices and were less active, had longer interbirth intervals, and spent more time in contact with infants, but had infants of lower masses and survival rates. Taken together, our results provide strong evidence for the occurrence of reproductive senescence in free-ranging female rhesus macaques but are also consistent with some of the predictions of the terminal investment hypothesis.},

abstract = {Sleeping sickness describes two diseases, both fatal if left untreated: (i) Gambian sleeping sickness caused by Trypanosoma brucei gambiense, a chronic disease with average infection lasting around 3 years, and (ii) Rhodesian sleeping sickness caused by T. b. rhodesiense, an acute disease with death occurring within weeks of infection. Control of Gambian sleeping sickness is based on case detection and treatment involving serological screening, followed by diagnostic confirmation and staging. In stage I, patients can remain asymptomatic as trypanosomes multiply in tissues and body fluids; in stage II, trypanosomes cross the blood-brain barrier, enter the central nervous system and, if left untreated, death follows. Staging is crucial as it defines the treatment that is prescribed; for both forms of disease, stage II involves the use of the highly toxic drug melarsoprol or, in the case of Gambian sleeping sickness, the use of complex and very expensive drug regimes. Case detection of T. b. gambiense sleeping sickness is known to be inefficient but could be improved by the identification of parasites using molecular tools that are, as yet, rarely used in the field. Diagnostics are not such a problem in relation to T. b. rhodesiense sleeping sickness, but the high level of under-reporting of this disease suggests that current strategies, reliant on self-reporting, are inefficient.Sleeping sickness is one of the 'neglected tropical diseases' that attracts little attention from donors or policymakers. Proper quantification of the burden of sleeping sickness matters, as the primary reason for its 'neglect' is that the true impact of the disease is unknown, largely as a result of under-reporting. Certainly, elimination will not be achieved without vast improvements in field diagnostics for both forms of sleeping sickness especially if there is a hidden reservoir of 'chronic carriers'. Mass screening would be a desirable aim for Gambian sleeping sickness and could be handled on a national scale in the endemic countries - perhaps by piggybacking on programmes committed to other diseases. As well as improved diagnostics, the search for non-toxic drugs for stage II treatment should remain a research priority.There is good evidence that thorough active case finding is sufficient to control T. b. gambiense sleeping sickness, as there is no significant animal reservoir. Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense sleeping sickness is a zoonosis and control involves interrupting the fly-animal-human cycle, so some form of tsetse control and chemotherapy of the animal reservoir must be involved. The restricted application of insecticide to cattle is the most promising, affordable and sustainable technique to have emerged for tsetse control. Animal health providers can aid disease control by treating cattle and, when allied with innovative methods of funding (e.g. public-private partnerships) not reliant on the public purse, this approach may prove more sustainable.Sleeping sickness incidence for the 36 endemic countries has shown a steady decline in recent years and we should take advantage of the apparent lull in incidence and aim for elimination. This is feasible in some sleeping sickness foci but must be planned and paid for increasingly by the endemic countries themselves. The control and elimination of T. b. gambiense sleeping sickness may be seen as a public good, as appropriate strategies depend on local health services for surveillance and treatment, but public-private funding mechanisms should not be excluded. It is timely to take up the tools available and invest in new tools - including novel financial instruments - to eliminate this disease from Africa. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION The singular opportunity to eliminate human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) has come to be widely acknowledged, both by the World Health Organization (WHO) and within the broad network it coordinates. The Atlas of HAT is the cornerstone of a system required to provide evidence and monitor the elimination process. We present here how the Atlas is rising to the challenge and we discuss the yet-to-be-resolved issues. METHODS AND MATERIALS Information on all HAT cases reported from endemic and non-endemic countries is collated, standardized, georeferenced, and included in a database (start year: 2000). RESULTS of all active screening campaigns are also included. Maps of HAT distribution and risk are subsequently generated at a variety of scales. For risk estimation, a kernelsmoothed function is calculated, based on HAT reported cases and Landscan databases of human population. The Atlas also maps health facilities providing HAT diagnosis and treatment, and the coverage of active and passive surveillance. RESULTS Ninety-three percent of reported cases are mapped at the village level (181 872/196 459, period 2000-2012), the others being referenced at the focus level. The average accuracy is estimated at 900 m. Completeness and accuracy of mapping are steadily improving, as reporting is standardized and the use of Global Positioning System (GPS) expands. Trends in gambiense HAT risk between the periods 2003-2007 and 2008- 2012 show a sharp drop, with a 57{\%} reduction for the population at moderate, high and very high risk. A similar decrease is observed for rhodesiense HAT (i.e. 62.3{\%} reduction in the same risk categories). CONCLUSIONS The Atlas of HAT increasingly underpins a wide range of control, research and advocacy activities. Capacity building and transfer of national database and the technology for its exploitation in endemic countries is ongoing. Underdetection and under-reporting pose the main challenges to the Atlas. To address them, statistical models will be used to estimate how many cases go undetected or unreported, and where. Ecological modelling could also shed some light on the risk of HAT away from the known focal areas of endemicity. To enhance timeliness, efforts will also be made to reduce the turnaround time between data reporting and mapping. As we look ahead at HAT elimination, the importance of putting and keeping the disease on the map cannot but increase.},

Muzari Keywords: Glossina; nutrition; postpartum; pregnant; tsetse; warthog burrows; Zimbabwe Abstract In Zimbabwe, female tsetse Glossina pallidipes Austen, collected from artificial warthog burrows and subjected to ovarian dissection and nutritional analysis, provide the first field estimates of resource allocation from mother to offspring across all of pregnancy. Approximately 45{\%} of 1833 females captured are full-term pregnant on entering the burrow. The remainder presumably use burrows as refuges at temperatures {\textgreater}32[degrees]C. Maternal residual dry weight (RDW) increases by 1.5mg after the first feed post-larviposition but, thereafter, only by 1.4mg by 90{\%} of pregnancy completion. Uterine RDW changes little by 60{\%} of pregnancy completion but increases by {\textgreater}6mg by parturition. Between the times of 5{\%} and 90{\%} pregnancy completion, maternal RDW is approximately constant: it then declines 2.8mg by parturition, balancing larval gains of 2.6mg. Mothers accumulate 6.3mg of fat in the first 80{\%} of pregnancy, while uterine fat increases by only 0.8mg. Thereafter, by parturition, larval fat increases by 4.1mg, whereas maternal fat declines by 3.3mg. The larva deposited is 5{\%} heavier than its mother and has 52{\%} more fat. RDW and fat levels, corrected for fly size and haematin, are 1 and 2mg, respectively, lower in females from traps than those from burrows. Burrow catches provide an improved picture of tsetse pregnancy dynamics, highlighting a reproductive strategy involving resource commitment to the larva being delayed until late pregnancy when sufficient stores guarantee viable pupal production. Larval development in tsetse starts significantly later than the analogous changes during pregnancy in two mammals and two viviparous fish.},

abstract = {The low survival rate of Trypanosoma brucei in tsetse flies is interpreted as in part at least the result of an establishment barrier. This barrier appears to be less active in young flies than in older flies. The growth rate of the peritrophic membrane is 1 mm./hour during the first 30 hours after emergence, and also after feeding. The distribution of the blood meal in relation to the growth of the peritrophic membrane makes it appear unlikely that the membrane itself is the barrier mechanism. A postulated adjustment period for trypanosomes in the crop of young flies (with an incomplete peritrophic membrane) is supported by cytochemical evidence concerning an enzymic transformation within 1 hour of feeding. This phenomenon implies a double transformation for successful host transfer: one (well established) in the vertebrate host sometime before transfer, a second (new) in the fly, immediately after transfer. The destruction of non-transformed trypanosomes in the mid-gut (after leaving the crop) of mature tsetse flies is considered to be the main establishment barrier. {\textcopyright} 1973.},

abstract = {To explain the general tendency of large mothers to produce large offspring, we developed two models in which either the rate at which each single offspring extracts resources from the mother or the rate at which the mother supplies resources to all the offspring is limited (terminal- or upper-stream-limitation on resource transport, respectively). We also reanalyzed the data of Erythronium japonicum to test the models. The terminal-stream-limitation model predicted that the optimal offspring size that maximizes the fitness of the mother increases with an increase in the maximum rate of resource extraction by each single offspring. Thus, large mothers produce large offspring if the maximum resource extraction rate is high in those mothers. The upper-stream-limitation model predicted that the optimal offspring size decreases with an increase in the maximum rate of resource supply by the mother to all the offspring. In E. japonicum, the maximum growth rate of a seed was independent of the number of seeds of a plant, suggesting that the resource extraction rate is limited at the individual seed level. The maximum growth rate was high in large plants and had a strong positive effect on final seed mass. Thus, the results were consistent with the terminal-stream-limitation model.},

abstract = {In tsetse flies, nutrients for intrauterine larval development are synthesized by the modified accessory gland (milk gland) and provided in mother's milk during lactation. Interference with at least two milk proteins has been shown to extend larval development and reduce fecundity. The goal of this study was to perform a comprehensive characterization of tsetse milk proteins using lactation-specific transcriptome/milk proteome analyses and to define functional role(s) for the milk proteins during lactation. Differential analysis of RNA-seq data from lactating and dry (non-lactating) females revealed enrichment of transcripts coding for protein synthesis machinery, lipid metabolism and secretory proteins during lactation. Among the genes induced during lactation were those encoding the previously identified milk proteins (milk gland proteins 1-3, transferrin and acid sphingomyelinase 1) and seven new genes (mgp4-10). The genes encoding mgp2-10 are organized on a 40 kb syntenic block in the tsetse genome, have similar exon-intron arrangements, and share regions of amino acid sequence similarity. Expression of mgp2-10 is female-specific and high during milk secretion. While knockdown of a single mgp failed to reduce fecundity, simultaneous knockdown of multiple variants reduced milk protein levels and lowered fecundity. The genomic localization, gene structure similarities, and functional redundancy of MGP2-10 suggest that they constitute a novel highly divergent protein family. Our data indicates that MGP2-10 function both as the primary amino acid resource for the developing larva and in the maintenance of milk homeostasis, similar to the function of the mammalian casein family of milk proteins. This study underscores the dynamic nature of the lactation cycle and identifies a novel family of lactation-specific proteins, unique to Glossina sp., that are essential to larval development. The specificity of MGP2-10 to tsetse and their critical role during lactation suggests that these proteins may be an excellent target for tsetse-specific population control approaches.},

abstract = {Three models for feeding in female tsetse are considered. Model I: there is a prolonged non-feeding phase after each meal followed by feeding at a constant rate, with a constant probability of dying as a consequence of feeding. Model II: the feeding rate increases linearly after each meal. Model III: the feeding rate increases exponentially after each meal. In Models II and III the feeding hazard is a linear function of the probability of feeding. Production of viable female offspring is estimated under each model, making allowance for losses of adults due to starvation and to background and feeding mortality, losses of pupae due to predation and parasitization, and losses of young flies if their mothers take insufficient blood during pregnancy. Under Model I, if females require three meals to produce viable pupae in 9 days, then for a non-decreasing population with a background mortality of 1{\%}/day, and 25{\%} pupal losses due to predation and parasitism, the feeding risk must be {\textless} or = 5{\%}/feed. At this maximum level the non-feeding phase should be 2-2.5 days for optimal productivity, with a mean feeding interval of 60-72 h. If the background mortality is 2{\%}/day, feeding losses cannot exceed 1{\%}/feed for a non-decreasing population. If four or five meals are required for the production of fully viable pupae, the optimal values of the non-feeding phase and mean feeding interval tend towards 1 and 2 days respectively. Under Models II and III the mean feeding interval is 50-60 h for optimal productivity (with variances 3 times as large as for Model I), in good agreement with estimates from recent models for feeding and digestion. Field evidence suggests that feeding tsetse take greater risks as their fat levels dwindle. This should result in feeding (and feeding mortality) rates which increase during the feeding phase--as assumed in Models II and III but not in Model I. These models allow greater flexibility than Model I, because flies can feed early in the hunger cycle, at low probability, as long as the feeding risk is also low.},

abstract = {Background: Tsetse-transmitted African trypanosomes cause both nagana (African animal Trypanosomiasis-AAT) and sleeping sickness (human African Trypanosomiasis-HAT) across Sub-Saharan Africa. Vector control and chemotherapy are the contemporary methods of tsetse and trypanosomiasis control in this region. In most African countries, including Uganda, veterinary services have been decentralised and privatised. As a result, livestock keepers meet the costs of most of these services. To be sustainable, AAT control programs need to tailor tsetse control to the inelastic budgets of resource-poor small scale farmers. To guide the process of tsetse and AAT control toolkit selection, that now, more than ever before, needs to optimise resources, the costs of different tsetse and trypanosomiasis control options need to be determined. Methods: A detailed costing of the restricted application protocol (RAP) for African trypanosomiasis control in Tororo District was undertaken between June 2012 and December 2013. A full cost calculation approach was used; including all overheads, delivery costs, depreciation and netting out transfer payments to calculate the economic (societal) cost of the intervention. Calculations were undertaken in Microsoft Excel™ without incorporating probabilistic elements. Results: The cost of delivering RAP to the project was US{\$} 6.89 per animal per year while that of 4 doses of a curative trypanocide per animal per year was US{\$} 5.69. However, effective tsetse control does not require the application of RAP to all animals. Protecting cattle from trypanosome infections by spraying 25 {\%}, 50 {\%} or 75 {\%} of all cattle in a village costs US{\$} 1.72, 3.45 and 5.17 per animal per year respectively. Alternatively, a year of a single dose of curative or prophylactic trypanocide treatment plus 50 {\%} RAP would cost US{\$} 4.87 and US{\$} 5.23 per animal per year. Pyrethroid insecticides and trypanocides cost 22.4 and 39.1 {\%} of the cost of RAP and chemotherapy respectively. Conclusions: Cost analyses of low cost tsetse control options should include full delivery costs since they constitute 77.6 {\%} of all project costs. The relatively low cost of RAP for AAT control and its collateral impact on tick control make it an attractive option for livestock management by smallholder livestock keepers.},

The main effect of these residues was to increase the trap-entering responses of tsetse once they reached the trap; in addition, the urine brought G. pallidipes to the traps. The efficacy of the residues persisted for at least two months after initial exposure, although urine on soil was ineffective after two days. Efficacies were not affected by the presence of l-octen-3-ol, acetone or butanone as additional attractants but were lower in the presence of carbon dioxide and lower with electrified visual targets than with traps. A ten times increase in dose caused no clear increase in catches, ten jars of urine being repellent, but catches increased when the urine and sacks were used together. Introduction},

Each day's increase was steeper than the overall rate, and apparently modulated in the V-shaped pattern typical of other responses in tsetse flies.

For MI this occurred after 5 weeks PI while for MHCT and MAECT these sustainable high levels were reached in the 7th week PI. BCT and SDS never detected all buffaloes infected. The influence of time and temperature on the viability of T. evansi in heparinized blood from water buffalo was also studied. In general we observed that the survival time tends to be longer when blood is kept at 4°C. In samples kept in direct sunlight parasites became undetectable with the MHCT after 30 min. After treatment of the water buffaloes with diminazene aceturate, the PCR signal disappeared within 24h. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract = {A matrix model is used to describe the dynamics of a population of female tsetse flies structured by parity (i.e., by the number of larvae laid). For typical parameter values, the intrinsic growth rate of the population is zero when the adult daily survival rate is 0.970, corresponding to an adult life expectancy of 1/0.030 = 33.3 days. This value is plausible and consistent with results found earlier by others. The intrinsic growth rate is insensitive to the variance of the interlarval period. Temperature being a function of the time of the year, a known relationship between temperature and mean pupal and interlarval times was used to produce a time-varying version of the model which was fitted to temperature and (estimated) population data. With well-chosen parameter values, the modeled population replicated at least roughly the population data. This illustrates dynamically the abiotic effect of temperature on population growth. Given that tsetse flies are the vectors of trypanosomiasis ("sleeping sickness") the model provides a framework within which future transmission models can be developed in order to study the impact of altered temperatures on the spread of this deadly disease. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Understanding why organisms senesce is a fundamental question in biology. One common explanation is that senescence results from an increase in macromolecular damage with age. The tremendous variation in lifespan between genetically identical queen and worker ants, ranging over an order of magnitude, provides a unique system to study how investment into processes of somatic maintenance and macromolecular repair influence lifespan. Here we use RNAseq to compare patterns of expression of genes involved in DNA and protein repair of age-matched queens and workers. There was no difference between queens and workers in 1-day-old individuals, but the level of expression of these genes increased with age and this up-regulation was greater in queens than in workers, resulting in significantly queen-biased expression in 2-month-old individuals in both legs and brains. Overall, these differences are consistent with the hypothesis that higher longevity is associated with increased investment into somatic repair.},

abstract = {Existing attempts to estimate the survival rate of tsetse flies from ovarian age distributions generally assume that the population is stationary. The fact that the survival rate cannot be dissociated from the growth rate by these methods poses a problem. Under the assumption of a stable age distribution, we propose a maximum likelihood method to estimate the ?apparent survival rate? for three categories of females: nulliparous (b0), young parous (b1) and old parous flies (b2). The rate depends both on ?real survival rates? a0, a1 and a2, and a growth rate l: b0 = a0/l, b1 = a1/l, and b2 = a2/l. We used a matrix model, which can be parameterized if the pupal survival rate and the pupal period are known. Replacing a0, a1 and a2 by b0,l, b1l, and b2l in the projection matrix, the problem amounts to calculating its dominant eigen-value l, and hence a0, a1 and a2. The application to a field population of Glossina palpalis gambiensis Vanderplank in Burkina Faso showed there was a marked difference in survival rate according to age category. The average survival rate increased with age with decreasing variability. The results suggested that sampling (by trapping) may have had an effect on the dynamics of this tsetse population by ageing it artificially. This method may be a useful tool for monitoring tsetse control.},

abstract = {Theory suggests females should optimize resource allocation across reproductive bouts to maximize lifetime reproduction, balancing current and future reproductive efforts according to physiological state and projected survival and reproduction. Tests of these ideas focus on long-lived vertebrates: few measure age-related reproductive output in iteroparous invertebrates, or partition reserves between those allocated to offspring versus mothers. We investigated how maternal age, and environmental and physiological factors influence reproductive investment in wild tsetse, Glossina pallidipes Austen and G. morsitans morsitans Westwood. Tsetse provide a tractable system to measure reproductive allocation. Females exhibit high maternal investment, producing single, large offspring that rely exclusively on maternal reserves. We find that mothers in better physiological condition and experiencing cooler temperatures produce larger offspring. Pupal size increases significantly but weakly with age. In both species, females with less fat invest proportionately more in offspring. Post-partum fat decreases in flies with badly frayed wings: poor flight capability may limit their feeding efficiency, or they may sacrifice more reserves as a terminal investment. Our results support evidence that offspring size increases},

abstract = {A total of 4420 male Glossina morsitans morsitans Westwood were captured on man fly-rounds in Katete District, Eastern Province, Zambia between February 1991 and December 1993. Of these flies, 1680 were captured before June 1992, during which period 989 flies were also captured on odour- baited electric screens operated in the same area. Non-teneral flies were analysed for fat, haematin and residual dry weight and their wing-vein length was measured. There were well marked annual cycles in wing length, fat and residual dry weight. Flies were biggest at the end of the rainy season, and smallest at the end of the hot dry season. Fat levels were lowest before the onset of the rains and highest in the cool season. Residual dry weight was a function of haematin content and the degree of wing-fray; these factors were used to correct the residual dry weight to zero haematin. Corrected residual dry weight and wing-vein lengths were most highly correlated with relative humidity in the month prior to capture (r {\textgreater} 0.8 and 0.6 respectively). Correlations with saturation deficit were weaker; temperature accounted for {\textless}20{\%} of the variance. Fly- round flies had a consistently higher residual dry weight than those from the electric screen, but their fat levels were lower. The distributions of log haematin levels differed little between the two sampling methods and were adequately described by a model where capture and feeding rates increased exponentially after each meal. The increase in the feeding rate after each meal differed little with season and was closely similar to that estimated for female G. pallidipes Austen in Zimbabwe},

abstract = {A full-factorial study of the effects of rates of temperature change and start temperatures was undertaken for both upper and lower critical thermal limits (CTLs) using the tsetse fly, Glossina pallidipes. Results show that rates of temperature change and start temperatures have highly significant effects on CTLs, although the duration of the experiment also has a major effect. Contrary to a widely held expectation, slower rates of temperature change (i.e. longer experimental duration) resulted in poorer thermal tolerance at both high and low temperatures. Thus, across treatments, a negative relationship existed between duration and upper CTL while a positive relationship existed between duration and lower CTL. Most importantly, for predicting tsetse distribution, G. pallidipes suffer loss of function at less severe temperatures under the most ecologically relevant experimental conditions for upper (0.06°C min -1; 35°C start temperature) and lower CTL (0.06°C min -1; 24°C start temperature). This suggests that the functional thermal range of G. pallidipes in the wild may be much narrower than previously suspected, approximately 20-40°C, and highlights their sensitivity to even moderate temperature variation. These effects are explained by limited plasticity of CTLs in this species over short time scales. The results of the present study have broad implications for understanding temperature tolerance in these and other terrestrial arthropods. {\textcopyright} 2007 The Royal Society.},

Key assumptions: We model a capital-breeding life history where an individual matures with all reserves available for reproduction. Results: We find that mortality risk and density-dependent offspring survival favour variation in allocation patterns. We predict that in species with sibling competition, females will reduce clutch size, but can compensate for fewer numbers of offspring with plasticity in offspring size and by reproducing several times over their life. In habitats with low mortality risk and some sibling competition, we predict an increased optimal offspring size in larger and older females.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The IAEA colony is the only one available for mass rearing of Glossina pallidipes, a vector of human and animal African trypanosomiasis in eastern Africa. This colony is the source for Sterile Insect Technique (SIT) programs in East Africa. The source population of this colony is unclear and its genetic diversity has not previously been evaluated and compared to field populations. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We examined the genetic variation within and between the IAEA colony and its potential source populations in north Zimbabwe and the Kenya/Uganda border at 9 microsatellites loci to retrace the demographic history of the IAEA colony. We performed classical population genetics analyses and also combined historical and genetic data in a quantitative analysis using Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC). There is no evidence of introgression from the north Zimbabwean population into the IAEA colony. Moreover, the ABC analyses revealed that the foundation and establishment of the colony was associated with a genetic bottleneck that has resulted in a loss of 35.7{\%} of alleles and 54{\%} of expected heterozygosity compared to its source population. Also, we show that tsetse control carried out in the 1990's is likely reduced the effective population size of the Kenya/Uganda border population. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: All the analyses indicate that the area of origin of the IAEA colony is the Kenya/Uganda border and that a genetic bottleneck was associated with the foundation and establishment of the colony. Genetic diversity associated with traits that are important for SIT may potentially have been lost during this genetic bottleneck which could lead to a suboptimal competitiveness of the colony males in the field. The genetic diversity of the colony is lower than that of field populations and so, studies using colony flies should be interpreted with caution when drawing general conclusions about G. pallidipes biology.},

It also limits our ability to evaluate novel disease control strategies that specifically target mosquito longevity. We report the development of a transcriptional profiling approach to determine age of adult female Aedes aegypti under field conditions. We demonstrate that this approach surpasses current cuticular hydrocarbon methods for both accuracy of predicted age as well as the upper limits at which age can be reliably predicted. The method is based on genes that display age-dependent expression in a range of dipteran insects and, as such, is likely to be broadly applicable to other disease vectors.},

abstract = {Interpretation of global biodiversity change is hampered by a lack of information on the historical status of most species in most parts of the world. Here we show that declines and increases can be deduced from current species distributions alone, using spatial patterns of occupancy combined with distribution size. Declining species show sparse, fragmented distributions for their distribution size, reflecting the extinction process; expanding species show denser, more aggregated distributions, reflecting colonization. Past distribution size changes for British butterflies were deduced successfully from current distributions, and former distributions had some power to predict future change. What is more, the relationship between distribution pattern and change in British butterflies independently predicted distribution change for butterfly species in Flanders, Belgium, and distribution change in British rare plant species is similarly related to spatial distribution pattern. This link between current distribution patterns and processes of distribution change could be used to assess relative levels of threat facing different species, even for regions and taxa lacking detailed historical and ecological information.$\backslash$n},

This is even more important to understand when dealing with important neglected diseases and their vectors.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In this paper, we analysed genetic divergence, computed from seven microsatellite loci, of 614 tsetse flies (Glossina palpalis gambiensis and Glossina palpalis palpalis, major vectors of animal and human trypanosomes) from 28 sites of West and Central Africa. We found that the two subspecies are so divergent that they deserve the species status. Controlling for geographic and time distances that separate these samples, which have a significant effect, we found that G. p. gambiensis from different landscapes (Niayes of Senegal, savannah and coastal environments) were significantly genetically different and thus represent different ecotypes or subspecies. We also confirm that G. p. palpalis from Ivory Coast, Cameroon and DRC are strongly divergent.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These results provide an opportunity to examine whether new tsetse fly ecotypes might display different behaviour, dispersal patterns, host preferences and vectorial capacities. This work also urges a revision of taxonomic status of Glossina palpalis subspecies and highlights again how fast ecological divergence can be, especially in host-parasite-vector systems.},

abstract = {1. When males repeatedly produce energetically expensive sexual signals, trade-offs between current and future investment can cause plasticity in age-dependent signalling. Such variation is often interpreted as alternate adaptive strategies: live fast and die young vs. slow and steady. 2. An alternative (yet rarely tested) explanation is that condition-dependent constraints on allocation cause variation in signalling with age (‘late bloomers' do not have early investment options). Testing this hypothesis is challenging because resource acquisition and allocation are difficult to measure, and energetic reserves both affect and are affected by reproductive effort. 3. We simultaneously manipulated acquisition (through dietary nutrition) and access to poten- tial mates (as a proxy for manipulating sexual trait allocation) in male decorated crickets (Gryllodes sigillatus), while measuring age- and signalling effort-mediated changes in energy storage components. 4. Increased diet quality caused increased signalling effort and energy storage, while access to females increased both the likelihood of and time spent signalling. Males with lower resource budgets signalled less, but still suffered energetic storage loss and viability costs. 5. Our results suggest that energetic constraints, rather than strategic resource accumulation, reduced signalling levels in males with lower resource acquisition ability. Our findings imply a non-adaptive explanation for age-dependent variation in sexual signalling, and an important role for energetic constraints in maintaining the honesty of costly behavioural displays.},

abstract = {Tsetse flies Glossina palpalis gambiensis and G. tachinoides are among the major vectors of sleeping sickness (Human African Trypanosomiasis-HAT) and nagana (African Animal Trypanosomiasis - AAT) in West Africa. Both riparian species occur sympatrically in gallery forests of south west Burkina Faso, but little is known of their interspecies relationships although different authors think there may be some competition between them. The aim of this study was to check if sympatric species have different strategies when approaching a host. A man placed in a sticky cube (1 m × 1 m × 1 m) and a sticky black-blue-black target (1 m × 1 m) were used to capture tsetse along the Comoe river banks in a Latin Square design. The number and the height at which tsetse were caught by each capture method were recorded according to species and sex. Glossina p. gambiensis was more attracted to human bait than to the target, but both species were captured at a significantly higher height on the target compared with the human bait (P {\textless} 0.05). No significant difference in heights was found between G. tachinoides and G. p. gambiensis captured on targets (33 and 35 cm, respectively, P {\textgreater} 0.05). However, catches on human bait showed a significant difference in height between G. tachinoides and G. p. gambiensis (22.5 and 30.6 cm, respectively, P {\textless} 0.001). This study showed that these sympatric species had different attack behaviours to humans, which is not the case with the target. The implications of these findings are discussed.},

abstract = {In the past few years a number of antibody biomarkers have been developed to distinguish between recent and established Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection. Typically, a specific threshold/cut-off of the biomarker is chosen, values below which are indicative of recent infections. Such biomarkers have attracted considerable interest as the basis for incidence estimation using a cross-sectional sample. An estimate of HIV incidence can be obtained from the prevalence of recent infection, as measured in the sample, and knowledge of the time spent in the recent infection state, known as the window period. However, such calculations are based on a number of assumptions concerning the distribution of the window period. We compare two statistical methods for estimating the mean and distribution of a window period using data on repeated measurements of an antibody biomarker from a cohort of HIV seroconverters. The methods account for the interval-censored nature of both the date of seroconversion and the date of crossing a specific threshold. We illustrate the methods using repeated measurements of the Avidity Index (AI) and make recommendations about the choice of threshold for this biomarker so that the resulting window period satisfies the assumptions for incidence estimation.},

The limit of the growth rate was studied and the results were satisfactory when compared with data of tsetse fly mass rearing. The effect of adult and pupal survival rates on the growth rate was examined and confirmed the importance of adult survival. Sensitivity analysis showed that the growth rate was particularly sensitive to change in the survival rate of young nulliparous females.

abstract = {Tsetse flies are the cyclical vectors of deadly human and animal trypanosomes in sub-Saharan Africa. Tsetse control is a key component for the integrated management of both plagues, but local eradication successes have been limited to less than 2{\%} of the infested area. This is attributed to either resurgence of residual populations that were omitted from the eradication campaign or reinvasion from neighboring infested areas. Here we focused on Glossina palpalis gambiensis, a riverine tsetse species representing the main vector of trypanosomoses in West Africa. We mapped landscape resistance to tsetse genetic flow, hereafter referred to as friction, to identify natural barriers that isolate tsetse populations. For this purpose, we fitted a statistical model of the genetic distance between 37 tsetse populations sampled in the region, using a set of remotely sensed environmental data as predictors. The least-cost path between these populations was then estimated using the predicted friction map. The method enabled us to avoid the subjectivity inherent in the expert-based weighting of environmental parameters. Finally, we identified potentially isolated clusters of G. p. gambiensis habitat based on a species distribution model and ranked them according to their predicted genetic distance to the main tsetse population. The methodology presented here will inform the choice on the most appropriate intervention strategies to be implemented against tsetse flies in different parts of Africa. It can also be used to control other pests and to support conservation of endangered species.},

The addition of natural urine to the synthetic mixture did not increase catches further, indicating that the phenols account for essentially all the attractiveness of cattle urine. 4-Methylphenol and 3-n-propylphenol were shown to be the naturally-occurring components essential for attractiveness, and 2-methoxyphenol was found to reduce attractiveness. 4-Methylphenol alone was slightly attractive to both species, but only for males, increasing catches by approximately 30{\%}. Catches of both species were increased by approximately 50{\%} by 3-n-propylphenol. The addition of 4-methylphenol increased catches of G. pallidipes by up to a further four times, but catches of G. m. morsitans were decreased. Of 14 other phenols tested, phenol, 3-methylphenol and 4-ethylphenol increased the attractiveness of 3-n-propylphenol to G. pallidipes without decreasing the attractiveness to G. m. morsitans; (E)- and (Z)-3-(1-propenyl)phenol, potential contaminants in 3-n- propylphenol, did not reduce the attractiveness of mixtures of 3-n-propylphenol and 4-methylphenol, and the E and, to a lesser extent, the Z isomer could substitute for 3-n-pro-pylphenol in these mixtures.

abstract = {The control of feeding in tsetse flies (Glossina spp.) (Diptera: Glossinidae) is based on the two major variables which characterize the nutritional state of a fly, stored fat and haematin, the latter being the residue of the last blood meal. Bursell (1961a,b) stated that 'the feeding response starts at fat contents of about 24{\%} [0.24)', and Randolph {\&} Rogers (1981) came to the conclusion that 'both haematin and fat reserves influence fly behaviour'. Brady (1972a,bi 1973a) investigated the acti$\backslash$ity, visual responsiveness and probing responsive-ness of flies with increased starvation and conjectured that '. ..increased sensory input from the systems monitoring the fly's state of starvation (Brady, 1973b) lowers the thresholds of a whole array of responses, particularly to host-associated stimuli.' He continued to examine the role of various physiological factors (including fat and haematin) in the mediation of the increase in activity seen as llies become 'hungrier' (Brady, 1975), as would be required for a fly to intercept the odour plume of a potential host in the field. He found, however, that the changes in weight since emergence of mature flies fed three times correlated better with the activity on the day before death than did either fat or haematin. Baylis {\&} Nambiro (1993) showed that male G. pal/idipes Austen feeding from an ox had significantly lower levels of absolute fat than flies simultaneously sampled approaching the ox. Loke {\&} Randolph (1995) investigated the reciprocal effects of fat content and llight activity in male G. palpalis Robineau-Desvoidy held in an actograph in the laboratory. Groups of flies were fed at different intervals (two, three or four days) to produce different fat levels, and then their activity was recorded. The authors found that greater mean daily blood intake caused higher fat content in the flies and this resulted in more subsequent spontaneous flight activity. However, as Brady (1975) points out, 'hunger' is an anthropomorphic concept and difficult to quantify. The present study examines a new aspect of this behavioural complex: the relationship between stored fat and the size of blood meals taken by individual flies. Langley (1977) suggested that the physiological cessation of feeding may be controlled by stretch receptors in the abdomen of a fly. Glossina morsitans morsitans Westwood were obtained as pupae from the Tsetse Research Laboratory, Langford, Bristol. The pupae were kept at 25°C and 70{\%} relative humidity and the emerging adults at 25 ::t 1°C in an LD 12:12 h cycle at 35{\%} relative humidity. Flies were fed on the ears of half-lop rabbits three times before their final feeds, which were synchronized for each experiment. The flies were kept in cages of 20-25 individuals until, between the penultimate and final feeds, they were sexed and each male was placed in a separate 7.5 x 2.5 cm tube with a plastic mesh base to allow feeding. Only male flies were used since the metabolism of fat in female flies is much affected by changes involved in reproduction. Before and after the final feed, each male was weighed in its tube to an accuracy of 0.1 mg to allow the mass of the blood meal ingested to be calculated. The field experiments were conducted on mature male G. pallidipes at Rekomitjie Research Station in the Zambezi valley of Zimbabwe during late October and November 1991 (hot, dry season). A bait ox was tethered in a clearing in riverine woodland from 06.00-07.45 and 15.00-18.00 h each day; attracted flies which engorged were caught with hand nets from both sides of the ox by experienced field assistants. The ox's own odour was supplemented by a sachet of 4-methyl phenol:1-octen-3-ol:3-n-propyl phenol (8:4:1) and a separate bottle of acetone. Once caught, flies were transferred to 7.5 x 2.5 cm holding tubes and then weighed immediately. If any fly had to be kept for more than 5 min, such that some primary excretion had occurred, it was released without being used. Each fly was weighed on a field microbalance to ::to.1 mg, then immediately disabled by crushing the thorax for later determination of the haematin content of the blood meal and the state of the fat resef$\backslash$'es. Some flies were caught while probing but before they were allowed to feed, and weighed by the same procedure. By subtraction of the mean weight of the unfed, probing flies from the mean weight of the fed flies, average blood meal sizes were calculated. All disabled flies were transferred to small, labelled, polythene tubes and desiccated over silica gel for 72 h before sealing for later analysis. For both the laboratory and field experiments, the wings and legs of each fly were removed and the whole body was dried in a vacuum oven at 70°C for a minimum of 8 hand{\~{}}},

abstract = {The methods of Bailey and of Jolly and Seber were used to provide maximum likelihood estimates of population parameters for Jackson's classical mark-recapture experiments on males of the tsetse fly Glossina m. morsitans Westwood. These were compared with Jolly-Seber (J-S) estimates for the same fly from more recent work on Antelope Island, Lake Kariba, Zimbabwe. The Bailey estimates of birth and death rates and total population size had markedly lower variances than Jackson's originals. Both sets of estimates provided moving averages over 6-week periods, whereas the Jolly-Seber analysis provided independent weekly estimates and their variance is consequently higher. Saturation deficit and maximum temperature (Tmax) accounted for 11 and 16{\%} respectively of the variance in independent 4-week means of the weekly J-S survival probabilities. Analysis of covariance, carried out on a joint data set of smoothed J-S estimates of the survival probability in Tanzania and Zimbabwe, showed a significant effect of Tmaxon survival. When this effect was removed, the survival probability in the Tanzania studies was found to be 8{\%} lower than on Antelope Island. The two effects accounted for 50{\%} of the variance in the joint data. When saturation deficit was substituted for Tmax, regression only accounted for 35{\%} of the variance. If saturation deficit is important in determining tsetse survival, it must act on stages other than the post-teneral adult. Given the continuous increase in mortality, even at moderate temperatures, it is hard to envisage a direct effect of Tmax. There may be an indirect effect, however, via the number of hunger-related deaths resulting from the increase in the feeding rate with increasing temperature.},

If the vital rate measures the rate of production of one type of individual by another, then the sensitivity of growth rate is proportional to the reproductive value of the destination type and the representation in the stable stage distribution of the source type. This formal relationship exists in three forms: one limited to age-classified populations, a second that applies to stage- or age-classified populations, and a third that uses matrix calculus. Each uses a different set of formal demographic techniques; together they provide a relationship that beautifully cuts across different types of demographic models.},

abstract = {Evolutionary conflict between parents and offspring over parental resource investment is a significant selective force on the traits of both parents and offspring. Empirical studies have shown that for some species, the amount of parental investment is controlled by the parents, whereas in other species, it is controlled by the offspring. The main difference between these two strategies is the residual reproductive value of the parents or opportunities for future reproduction. Therefore, this could explain the patterns of control of parental investment at the species level. However, the residual reproductive value of the parents will change during their lifetime; therefore, parental influence on the amount of investment can be expected to change plastically. Here, we investigated control of parental investment when parents were young and had a high residual reproductive value, compared to when they were old and had a low residual reproductive value using a cross-fostering experiment in the burying beetle Nicrophorus quadripunctatus. We found that parents exert greater control over parental investment when they are young, but parental control is weakened as the parents age. Our results demonstrate that control of parental investment is not fixed, but changes plastically during the parent's lifetime.},

abstract = {In this study, we developed a stable and temporally dynamic model for predicting tsetse (Glossina pallidipes) habitat distribution based on a remotely sensed Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), an indicator of vegetation greenness, and topographic variables, specifically, elevation and topographic position index (TPI). We also investigated the effect of drainage networks on habitat suitability of tsetse as well as factors that may influence changes in area of suitable tsetse habitat. We used data on tsetse presence collected in North western Zimbabwe during 1998 to develop a habitat prediction model using Maxent (Training AUC = 0.751, test AU = 0.752). Results of the Maxent model showed that the probability of occurrence of tsetse decreased as TPI increased while an increase in elevation beyond 800 m resulted in a decrease in the probability of occurrence. High probabilities ({\textgreater}50{\%}) of occurrence of tsetse were associated with NDVI between high 0.3 and 0.6. Based on the good predictive ability of the model, we fitted this model to environmental data of six different years, 1986, 1991, 1993, 2002, 2007 and 2008 to predict the spatial distribution of tsetse presence in those years and to quantify any trends or changes in the tsetse distribution, which may be a function of changes in suitable tsetse habitat. The results showed that the amount of suitable tsetse habitat significantly decreased (r2 0.799, p = 0.007) for the period 1986 and 2008 due to the changes in the amount of vegetation cover as measured by NDVI over time in years. Using binary logistic regression, the probability of occurrence of suitable tsetse habitat decreased with increased distance from drainage lines. Overall, results of this study suggest that temporal changes in vegetation cover captured by using NDVI can aptly capture variations in habitat suitability of tsetse over time. Thus integration of remotely sensed data and other landscape variables enhances assessment of temporal changes in habitat suitability of tsetse which is crucial in the management and control of tsetse.},

The release rates of attractants, assessed gravimetrically or by GC analysis of volatiles released, were independent of the amount present. The rates were related directly to surface area, inversely related to wall thickness and increased exponentially with temperature. With blends of the attractants, the release rates of the two phenols were directly proportional to the concentration present, but that of octenol showed an exponential dependence. A similar exponential effect was seen with blends of the attractants and an involatile diluent. For mixtures of chemicals, the ratio of the released components was not affected significantly by temperature, sachet size or wall thickness. Release rates from polyethylene sachets and bottles in the field varied 100-fold according to temperature differences related to the time of day, season, and degree of insolation. Day-degree models to predict the losses of attractants from a polyethylene sachet in shade or in full sunlight were highly correlated (r-2 = 0.84 and 0.81 respectively) with observed losses. The practical implications of these findings are discussed.},

Warmer temperatures are expected to increase disease risks from food-borne pathogens, water-borne diseases, and vector-borne zoonoses in human and animal populations of Arctic landscapes. Existing high levels of mercury and persistent organic pollutant chemicals circulating within terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems in Arctic latitudes are a major concern for the reproductive health of humans and other mammals, and climate warming will accelerate the mobilization and biological amplification of toxic environmental contaminants. The adverse health impacts of Arctic warming will be especially important for wildlife populations and indigenous peoples dependent upon subsistence food resources from wild plants and animals. Additional research is needed to identify and monitor changes in the prevalence of zoonotic pathogens in humans, domestic dogs, and wildlife species of critical subsistence, cultural, and economic importance to Arctic peoples. The long-term effects of climate warming in the Arctic cannot be adequately predicted or mitigated without a comprehensive understanding of the interactive and synergistic effects between environmental contaminants and pathogens in the health of wildlife and human communities in Arctic ecosystems. The complexity and magnitude of the documented impacts of climate change on Arctic ecosystems, and the intimacy of connections between their human and wildlife communities, makes this region an appropriate area for development of One Health approaches to identify and mitigate the effects of climate warming at the community, ecosystem, and landscape scales.},

abstract = {Temperature has dramatic evolutionary fitness consequences and is therefore a major factor determining the geographic distribution and abundance of ectotherms. However, the role that age might have on insect thermal tolerance is often overlooked in studies of behaviour, ecology, physiology and evolutionary biology. Here, we review the evidence for ontogenetic and ageing effects on traits of high-and low-temperature tolerance in insects and show that these effects are typically pronounced for most taxa in which data are available. We therefore argue that basal thermal tolerance and acclimation responses (i.e. phenotypic plasticity) are strongly influenced by age and/or ontogeny and may confound studies of temperature responses if unaccounted for. We outline three alternative hypotheses which can be distinguished to propose why development affects thermal tolerance in insects. At present no studies have been undertaken to directly address these options. The implications of these age-related changes in thermal biology are discussed and, most significantly, suggest that the temperature tolerance of insects should be defined within the age-demographics of a particular population or species. Although we conclude that age is a source of variation that should be carefully controlled for in thermal biology, we also suggest that it can be used as a valuable tool for testing evolutionary theories of ageing and the cellular and genetic basis of thermal tolerance.},

abstract = {This paper examines the responses of the insect pollinators of the summer-flowering, understorey shrub, Lavandula latifolia (Labiatae) to the irradiance mosaic of the forest floor in a southeastern Spanish locality, and assesses the relationship between these responses and interspecific variation in thermal biology. Pollinators differed significantly in the mean irradiance at capture points (MICP), and a large percentage of species (59{\%}) preferentially selected plants in either shaded or sunlit conditions. Taxonomic affiliation (at the order level) and body size explained 78{\%} of interspecific variance in MICP. Dipterans tended to be restricted to situations of relatively row irradiance, whereas hymenopterans foraged over the entire irradiance gradient. MICP was inversely related to body size. Pollinators differed Significantly in mean thoracic temperature (T-th), thoracic temperature excess (T-exc = T-th - T-a [air temperature]), and slope of the T-th/T-a regression (which may be taken as a rough index of thermoregulatory ability). Hymenopterans had higher T-th and T-exc, and smaller T-th/T-a slopes, than dipterans. After accounting for this taxonomic effect, T-th and T-exc, but not T-th/T-a slope, increased with body size. MICP depended significantly on T-exc and, to a lesser degree, on T-th, and species characterised by high T-exc tended to select low-irradiance conditions. The relationship between MICP and body size was thus mediated by the correlations between the latter variable and thermal biology parameters. In the hot Mediterranean summer, as in other thermally stressing environments, thermal constraints of the kind reported in this study may generate within- and between-habitat variation in the composition and size structure of pollinator assemblages, which may be consequential for plant reproduction.},

abstract = {The taxonomic distribution and evolution of viviparity in Diptera is critically reviewed. The phenomenon ranges from ovoviviparity (eggs deposited at an advanced stage of embryonic development; larva emerges immediately after deposition), through viviparity (larva hatches inside female before deposition) to pupiparity (offspring deposited as pupa). Some Diptera are known to be facultatively viviparous, which is hypothesized to be a step towards the evolution of obligate viviparity. Obligate viviparity is found to comprise unilarviparity (single large larva in maternal uterus) which evolved many times independently, the rare oligolarviparity (more than one but not more than 12 larvae) and multilarviparity (large numbers of developing eggs or larvae in uterus) which is typical for the two largest clades of viviparous Diptera. Unilarviparity is either lecithotrophic (developing larva nourished by yolk of egg) or pseudo-placental (larva nourished by glandular secretions of mother). Viviparity has clearly evolved on many separate occasions in Diptera. It is recorded in 22 families, and this review identifies at least 61 independent origins of viviparity. Six families appear to have viviparity in their ground-plan. Some families have a single evolution of viviparity, others multiple evolutions. Guimaraes' model for the evolution of viviparity in Diptera is tested against phylogenetic information and the adaptive significance of viviparity is reviewed in detail. Possible correlations with life-history parameters (coprophily, parasitism, breeding in ephemeral plant parts, malacophagy and adult feeding habits – especially haematophagy) are analysed critically, as are potential advantages (shorter larval life, less investment in yolk by mother, protection of vulnerable stages, better access to breeding substrates, predation on competitors). Morphological constraints, adaptations and exaptations are reviewed, including the provision of an incubation space for the egg(s), the positioning of the egg(s) in the uterus, and maternal glands. The main morphological adaptations include greater egg size, reduction of egg respiratory filaments, thinning of chorion, modified larval respiratory system and mouthparts, and instar skipping. Female morphology and behaviour is particularly strongly modified for viviparity. The terminalia are shortened, the vagina is more muscular and tracheated, and the ovaries of unilarviparous species have a reduced number of ovarioles with alternate ovulation. Many of the final conclusions are tentative, and a plea is made for more detailed morphological and experimental study of many of the viviparous species. Viviparity in Diptera provides a fascinating example of multiple parallel evolution, and a fertile field for future research.},

abstract = {1. The reproductive cycle of tsetse flies occupies a minimum of 55 or 56 days at 23o, made up of 12 days' ovarian development of the first egg (always in the right ovary), 3 or 4 days' embryonic development, 7 days' larval growth in utero, and 33 days as a pupa underground; the male pupal period is longer by about 6{\%}. Second and later larvae follow the first at 11‐day intervals, equal numbers of each sex. A special uterine organ assists eclosion and ecdysis. 2. The cycle varies with temperature but not with humidity. Failure to inseminate causes irregularities in ovulation; in nature the females almost invariably copulate once only, when seeking or taking the first meal. Males are potent after they are 4–6 days old. Some species will cross with each other but the male hybrids are infertile. 3. During the rains pupae are widely scattered, which has led observers to suppose that breeding is then interrupted; breeding grounds may also shift with season. 4. Pupae can survive slight frost; lethal high temperature varies from 40 to 57o according to shortness of exposure. They can develop within a range from about 16–31o, but at the extremes non‐viable flies result, and continual exposure to 30o sterilizes the ovaries of at least one species. 5. Loss of weight during pupal life is nearly independent of initial weight; it depends on humidity but not on temperature. 6. The size and weight of pupae depends on the temperature at which the mothers were living, and also on the timing of meals; three large meals are needed to produce a large larva, one shortly after larviposition and the third about 3 days before the larva is born. 7. Natural mortality of pupae (excluding predation and parasitization) may be zero in certain sites, but normally varies from 8 to 30 or 50{\%} with temperature. 8. Before the first meal the ptilinum remains eversible, the chitin is soft and the fly is called teneral. The constitution of the pupa, and of the teneral fly of given age, varies with the species, but the water and fat proportions are fairly constant, and there is little difference between the sexes. Smaller pupae and flies have proportionally less fat. Mean weight may vary seasonally in the proportion of 4–5. 9. Loss of water by starving teneral flies (and of course survival) is governed by temperature and humidity; loss of fat is governed by temperature; but the effect of humidity is controversial. Smaller individuals lose proportionally more weight than larger ones, and are less viable in the‐field. Death at low humidities is caused by water loss, before the fat reserves are used up. 10. About 2 mg. of fat is probably synthesized at each meal in nature, but in captivity fat synthesis is poor. Fat is also accumulated over several meals, at least up to the age of 3 weeks. It is doubtful whether water loss is or could be compensated by metabolism of fat. 11. Lethal high temperatures depend on humidity and time of exposure of the flies, as well as on species, but temperatures of 38–40o for 1–3 hr. may be lethal, especially at high humidity. As with pupae, light frost is tolerated for short periods, at least by some species. 12. The salivary glands secrete an anticoagulin and the mesenteron a strong coagulin; species feeding much on reptilian or avian bloods, which tend to clot easily, have larger salivary glands. The digestive enzymes are mainly proteolytic. The chitinous peritrophic membrane is formed afresh from the proventriculus at each meal, keeping pace with the enclosed blood on its progress along the mesenteron. 13. Precipitin tests have indicated that large bovids, giraffe and wart‐hog are important hosts of Glossina swynnertoni, but that zebra are not. Corpuscle measurements suggest that during the rains G. morsitans submorsitans feeds mainly on small antelope and wart‐hog; G. longipalpis can apparently survive on small antelope alone. Destruction or reduction of large ungulates sometimes eliminates G. morsitans; exceptionally this species maintains itself on man and his domestic animals. Five per cent of G. morsitans commonly take avian blood, but G. swynnertoni, G. longipalpis and G. pallidipes have an almost exclusively mammalian diet. 14. On the other hand, G. palpalis and G. tachinoides take much nucleated blood, and are scarcely affected by the absence of ungulates. 15. The eyes of Glossina are not more accurate than those of other Diptera, but may be adapted to perceive movement. G. swynnertoni can see large animals in a good light between 150 and 200 yards away and can scent them between 60 and 100 yards up‐wind; but G. morsitans with antennae occluded came to man as readily as normal flies. 16. Flies of the morsitans group feed about every 4th day at 23o, but the hunger cycle depends on temperature and probably humidity; more weight is lost shortly after the meal than later on. 17. Hungry G. morsitans (in East Africa at least) visit feeding grounds where animals are likely to be encountered; in so doing they are probably guided by a positive light reaction, which is reversed at high temperature (32o); they will follow artificial paths in absence of game. 18. Feeding grounds are used less during the rains, when in East Africa flies are least hungry because the onset of hunger is slow, and they can survive 2 weeks without a meal. But in West Africa G. morsitans submorsitans is hungriest in the cool, long‐grass season at the end of the rains, when large animals are scarce in its habitat and difficult to see. 19. The numbers of G. morsitans, G. stvynnertoni, G. palpalis and G. tachinoides caught by a standard method give a fair index of true density from time to time, but not necessarily from place to place. Attraction of G. pallidipes to man is usually very slight. 20. Male G. morsitans and G. stvynnertoni live about 4 weeks in nature, but life depends on temperature, and on saturation deficit at low or moderate temperatures. Fortunate individuals may survive 100 days; expectation of life is scarcely affected by age, since mean life is so much less than the possible span. Females live at least twice as long as males, and probably half the larvae deposited fail to become adult flies. 21. A mean saturation deficit of 7 mb. is optimal for G. morsitans, and 4 mb. for G. tachinoides; the level of density during the following year is determined by conditions at the end of the rains, when in a dry year density will rise and in a wet year it will fall. 22. Densities of G. stvynnertoni and G. pallidipes fluctuate to a long‐term cycle which may or may not be associated with sunspots. 23. G. morsitans, G. palpalis and G. tachinoides are most active at about 27o, and inactive outside the limits 15½ and 41½o. Some species are active in the dusk or at night, G. pallidipes especially on moonlight nights but G. austeni often in complete darkness. These two species are most active on the coast at high humidity, but inland on the arid plateau G. pallidipes is most active in dry weather. Attraction to man may be depressed by very high density of ungulates. 24. There is some agreement between the proportion of teneral flies caught and the emergence rate. The proportion of females caught depends upon hunger, but also it is associated with the emergence rate because younger females are more active; younger males, on the other hand, are less active than older ones. 25. The slow, coherent spread of G. morsitans fly‐belts advancing into favourable country argues that wandering animals do little to assist their spread; and quantitative estimates of dispersal from an area of 4 X 4 miles showed much to‐and‐fro movement over short distances, but only 3 {\%} weekly loss from flies passing off the scene altogether. 26. In open grassland G. swynnertoni will follow cattle more readily in the wet season, but even in the dry season may remain with the animals up to 1½ hr. This species will exceptionally travel, apparently unaided, up to 2 miles in 3 hr., and G. palpalis up to 5 miles a day. Copyright {\textcopyright} 1949, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved},

abstract = {For the first time a Bayesian geostatistical version of the Moran Curve, a logarithmic form of the Ricker stock recruitment curve, is proposed that is able to give an estimate of net change in population demographic rates considering components such as fertility and density dependent and density independent mortalities. The method is applied to spatio-temporally referenced count data of tsetse flies obtained from fly-rounds. The model is a linear regression with three components: population rate of change estimated from the Moran curve, an explicit spatio-temporal covariance, and the observation error optimised within a Bayesian framework. The model was applied to the three main climate seasons of Zambia (rainy - January to April, cold-dry - May to August, and hot-dry - September to December) taking into account land surface temperature and (seasonally changing) cattle distribution. The model shows a maximum positive net change during the hot-dry season and a minimum between the rainy and cold-dry seasons. Density independent losses are correlated positively with day-time land surface temperature and negatively with night-time land surface temperature and cattle distribution. The inclusion of density dependent mortality increases considerably the goodness of fit of the model. Cross validation with an independent dataset taken from the same area resulted in a very accurate estimate of tsetse catches. In general, the overall framework provides an important tool for vector control and eradication by identifying vector population concentrations and local vector demographic rates. It can also be applied to the case of sustainable harvesting of natural populations. {\textcopyright} 2014 Sedda et al.},

abstract = {The effects of juvenile hormone on the milk gland, ovaries, and fat body of adult female G. austeni were studied by allatectomy and hormone replacement therapy. In the absence of juvenile hormone, milk synthesis is slow, leading to the production, in a few cases, of small larvae over a prolonged inter-larval period. In most cases, no viable larva is produced and the fat body hypertrophies. Replacement of the corpus allatum with C16JH leads to a rapid synthesis of milk, production of normal-sized larvae and a reversal of the effect on the fat body. It is therefore suggested that the milk gland activity is directly influenced by JH. Allatectomy in most cases also results in only one egg being matured. The others do not enter vitellogenesis. Similarly, this effect on the ovaries can be reversed by topical application of C16JH. {\textcopyright} 1976.},

abstract = {This paper examines the melding of two discourses in southeastern Zimbabwe: land reform and wildlife management. The former seeks to redistribute large, 'under-utilized' landholdings to smallholders whilst the latter needs extensive land holdings to be viable. These two discourses are rooted in very different models of development. The land reform exercise emphasizes direct redistribution, equity and land for crops; whilst the wildlife management discourse tends to stress maximizing foreign exchange earnings, encouraging public-private partnerships and trickle down. Yet there has been a recent flurry of interest in the development of 'wildlife models' for land reform which would combine the two. This paper investigates whether the competing discourses about land for smallholders and wildlife-based land reform are compatible or can be successfully reconciled. It traces the ways they have come together in Zimbabwe's southeast lowveld and examines the 'science' and politics underlying their melding. Finally it explores the potential implications for rural people's livelihoods of this development. It concludes that land reform and wildlife management can be reconciled, but probably not in a particularly equitable way: it is more likely to provide an opening for an equitable land reform agenda to be usurped by local and non-local elites with wildlife interests. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

Dengue, West Nile and Chikungunya have recently caused substantial human epidemics. Arthropod-borne animal diseases like Bluetongue, Rift Valley fever and African horse sickness pose substantial threats to livestock economies around the world. Climate change can impact the vector-borne disease epidemiology. Changes in climate will influence arthropod vectors, their life cycles and life histories, resulting in changes in both vector and pathogen distribution and changes in the ability of arthropods to transmit pathogens. Climate can affect the way pathogens interact with both the arthropod vector and the human or animal host. Predicting and mitigating the effects of future changes in the environment like climate change on the complex arthropod-pathogen-host epidemiological cycle requires understanding of a variety of complex mechanisms from the molecular to the population level. Although there has been substantial progress on many fronts the challenges to effectively understand and mitigate the impact of potential changes in the environment on vector-borne pathogens are formidable and at an early stage of development. The challenges will be explored using several arthropod-borne pathogen systems as illustration, and potential avenues to meet the challenges will be presented.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Women may have persistent risk of HIV acquisition during pregnancy and postpartum. Estimating risk of HIV during these periods is important to inform optimal prevention approaches. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to estimate maternal HIV incidence during pregnancy/postpartum and to compare mother-to-child HIV transmission (MTCT) risk among women with incident versus chronic infection. METHODS AND FINDINGS We searched PubMed, Embase, and AIDS-related conference abstracts between January 1, 1980, and October 31, 2013, for articles and abstracts describing HIV acquisition during pregnancy/postpartum. The inclusion criterion was studies with data on recent HIV during pregnancy/postpartum. Random effects models were constructed to pool HIV incidence rates, cumulative HIV incidence, hazard ratios (HRs), or odds ratios (ORs) summarizing the association between pregnancy/postpartum status and HIV incidence, and MTCT risk and rates. Overall, 1,176 studies met the search criteria, of which 78 met the inclusion criterion, and 47 contributed data. Using data from 19 cohorts representing 22,803 total person-years, the pooled HIV incidence rate during pregnancy/postpartum was 3.8/100 person-years (95{\%} CI 3.0-4.6): 4.7/100 person-years during pregnancy and 2.9/100 person-years postpartum (p = 0.18). Pooled cumulative HIV incidence was significantly higher in African than non-African countries (3.6{\%} versus 0.3{\%}, respectively; p{\textless}0.001). Risk of HIV was not significantly higher among pregnant (HR 1.3, 95{\%} CI 0.5-2.1) or postpartum women (HR 1.1, 95{\%} CI 0.6-1.6) than among non-pregnant/non-postpartum women in five studies with available data. In African cohorts, MTCT risk was significantly higher among women with incident versus chronic HIV infection in the postpartum period (OR 2.9, 95{\%} CI 2.2-3.9) or in pregnancy/postpartum periods combined (OR 2.3, 95{\%} CI 1.2-4.4). However, the small number of studies limited power to detect associations and sources of heterogeneity. CONCLUSIONS Pregnancy and the postpartum period are times of persistent HIV risk, at rates similar to "high risk" cohorts. MTCT risk was elevated among women with incident infections. Detection and prevention of incident HIV in pregnancy/postpartum should be prioritized, and is critical to decrease MTCT.},

abstract = {This paper outlines the first part of a series of research studies to investigate the potential and approaches for using optical remote sensing to assess vegetation water content. It first analyzes why most methods used as approximations of vegetation water content (such as vegetation stress indices, estimation of degree of curing and chlorophyll content) are not suitable for retrieving water content at leaf level. It then documents the physical basis supporting the use of remote sensing to directly detect vegetation water content in terms of Equivalent Water Thickness (EWT) at leaf level. Using laboratory measurements, the radiative transfer model PROSPECT and a sensitivity analysis, it shows that shortwave infrared (SWIR) is sensitive to EWT but cannot be used alone to retrieve EWT because two other leaf parameters (internal structure and dry matter) also influence leaf reflectance in the SWIR. A combination of SWIR and NIR (only influenced by these two parameters) is necessary to retrieve EWT at leaf level. These results set the basis towards establishing operational techniques for the retrieval of EWT at top-of-canopy and top-of-atmospheric levels. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.

Climate change induced environmental challenges are viewed to be particularly severe to economically challenged tropical societies including the Zimbabwean rural communities. We sought to determine local level climate change trends and associated biophysical implications in the Makonde Communal Lands of Zimbabwe. Our findings suggest that there has been significant climate change in the Makonde Communal Lands since 1962. The climate change observed has induced the deterioration of ecosystem productivity, diversity and services, to the detriment of human livelihoods. We provide insights into how to better understand local level dynamics between climate change and local ecosystem goods and services as the basis of livelihood in marginalised rural communities. Among the key reasons for concern about impacts of anthropogenic activities on climate is the fact that changing climate has direct impacts on the biophysical world, which in turn is a vital asset for human livelihoods, economies and general well-being. {\textcopyright} 2015.

About 3 000 000 adults of G. pallidipes and 200 000 of G. m. morsitans originally present in the area as adults or pupae were killed by targets or removed by sampling procedures between March and December. At the end of this period, the tsetse populations in the centre of the block had declined by at least 99{\textperiodcentered}99{\%}. The targets dealt adequately with a strong invasion pressure from initially dense infestations nearby, partly because the targets reduced the abundance of tsetse up to 5–10 km outside the block. At 18 months after the start of the study, the targets were badly faded; this was corrected by spraying them with a black dye and an ultraviolet-light absorber that protected the dye and insecticide, but by then the targets had deteriorated and were without adequate odour attractant, and many were no longer being maintained. Tsetse then invaded further into the block, but only in small numbers. Tabanids and muscoids were not strongly attracted to targets; their population densities in and near the block did not change greatly. Targets offer a simple and ecologically clean method of controlling tsetse and preventing invasion.},

abstract = {Variation in pigmentation traits is an effective window to evolutionary processes due to their importance for survival and reproduction. In particular, one of the leading hypotheses for the maintenance of conspicuous pigmentation in natural populations is its signaling function in mate choice. Here, we demonstrate the occurrence of melanism in poeciliid fishes of the genus Poecilia that inhabits toxic, hydrogen sulfide springs in southern Mexico and the absence of melanism from closely related populations in reference habitats lacking hydrogen sulfide. Assays of female mate preference in both habitat types were used to examine whether divergence in female preference for melanism contributes to its maintenance in hydrogen sulfide springs. We found significant variation in female preferences for melanistic males. Specifically, melanistic females from the toxic spring exhibited a significant preference for melanistic males, while non-melanistic females from the same population exhibited no preference. Females from the non-sulfidic reference population discriminated strongly against melanistic males. Preferences of melanistic females appear to be a significant force in the maintenance of melanism in sulfidic habitats and suggest a change in preference as the divergence from non-sulfidic ancestors. Potential polymorphism in preference within the hydrogen sulfide spring indicates that preference for melanistic males may not be environmentally controlled.

The authors suggest that this overestimation occurs, in part, because people who are unskilled in these domains suffer a dual burden: Not only do these people reach erroneous conclusions and make unfortunate choices, but their incompetence robs them of the metacognitive ability to realize it. Across 4 studies, the authors found that participants scoring in the bottom quartile on tests of humor, grammar, and logic grossly overestimated their test performance and ability. Although their test scores put them in the 12th percentile, they estimated themselves to be in the 62nd. Several analyses linked this miscalibration to deficits in metacognitive skill, or the capacity to distinguish accuracy from error. Paradoxically, improving the skills of participants, and thus increasing their metacognitive competence, helped them recognize the limitations of their abilities.},

abstract = {* Temporal fluctuations in vital rates such as survival, growth or reproduction alter long-term population dynamics and can change the dynamics from invasion and population persistence to extinction. Projections of population dynamics made in the absence of such fluctuations may consequently be misleading. However, data for estimation of yearly fluctuations in demographic parameters are often limited. Accordingly, the current diverse range of statistical and demographic modelling strategies used for stochastic population modelling may influence predictions. * We used simulations to explore the effects of different methods of parameter estimation on projections of population dynamics obtained using stochastic integral projection models (IPMs). The simulations were built from data on a monocarpic thistle, Carlina vulgaris, and an ungulate, Soay sheep, Ovis aries; these populations are subject to yearly fluctuation in vital rates facilitating the exploration of the effects of different methods of model construction on the properties of stochastic IPMs. Specifically, we looked at effects on the stochastic growth rate, log $\lambda$s, and the mean and variance in the one-step population growth rate (Nt+1/Nt). * Our analyses showed that none of the tested approaches resulted in large biases in the estimation of log $\lambda$s. However, when realistic study durations (e.g. 12 years) were used for statistical modelling, the confidence intervals around the $\lambda$s estimates remained large. Estimation of the variance in one-step population growth rates, on the other hand, was strongly sensitive to the method employed, and the overestimation and underestimation of the variance were also influenced by the life history of the organism. * Our findings highlight the need to consider the influences of statistical and demographic modelling approaches when population dynamics have significant temporal stochasticity, as in population viability analyses and evolutionary predictions of bet hedging.},

abstract = {Aqueous extracts of brain, thoracic ganglion or corpora cardiaca of female Glossina morsitans were shown to contain a substance which inhibited the synthesis of lipid from l[U-14C] leucine by fat cells incubated in vitro. The highest concentration of this substance was found in the corpora cardiaca; approximately 1 × 10-6 gland pairs $\mu$l-1 were required for maximum inhibition. At concentrations greater than 1 × 10-4 gland pairs $\mu$l-1 the lipid synthesis inhibiting factor (hereafter referred to as the LSIF) was inactivated by the presence of a substance which could be removed by gel filtration. The concentration of LSIF in the corpora cardiaca and midbrain varied throughout the reproductive cycle of the female. Net release of LSIF from the midbrain occurred between the 2nd and 7th day of the 9-day reproductive cycle. Net release from the corpora cardiaca began on day 5 and continued until the end of the interlarval period on day 9. Results are consistent with the hypothesis that LSIF is synthesised mainly in the medial neurosecretory cells of the midbrain whereas the corpora cardiaca are the site of storage and release into the haemolymph. LSIF was present in midbrain and corpora cardiaca extracts from male G. morsitans but at lower concentrations than in females. No variation in LSIF concentration could be correlated with the feeding cycle. LSIF activity was not detected in fresh haemolymph but was found at high concentration in boiled haemolymph, suggesting the presence of an inhibitor which was inactivated at high temperature. Preliminary investigations into the nature of LSIF have shown it to be inactivated by proteolytic enzymes and to be recoverable in a single peak from a Sephadex G15 column. Results support the view that LSIF is a peptide hormone which, in conjunction with an inhibitor, controls the lipid synthetic ability of the fat cells of the adult female tsetse fly throughout the reproductive cycle. {\textcopyright} 1981.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Tsetse flies occur in much of sub-Saharan Africa where they are vectors of trypanosomes that cause human and animal African trypanosomosis. The sterile insect technique (SIT) is currently used to eliminate tsetse fly populations in an area-wide integrated pest management (AW-IPM) context in Senegal and Ethiopia. Three Glossina palpalis gambiensis strains [originating from Burkina Faso (BKF), Senegal (SEN) and an introgressed strain (SENbkf)] were established and are now available for use in future AW-IPM programmes against trypanosomes in West Africa. For each strain, knowledge of the environmental survival thresholds is essential to determine which of these strains is best suited to a particular environment or ecosystem, and can therefore be used effectively in SIT programmes. METHODS In this paper, we investigated the survival and fecundity of three G. p. gambiensis strains maintained under various conditions: 25 °C and 40, 50, 60, and 75 {\%} relative humidity (rH), 30 °C and 60 {\%} rH and 35 °C and 60 {\%} rH. RESULTS The survival of the three strains was dependent on temperature only, and it was unaffected by changing humidity within the tested range. The BKF strain survived temperatures above its optimum better than the SEN strain. The SENbkf showed intermediate resistance to high temperatures. A temperature of about 32 °C was the limit for survival for all strains. A rH ranging from 40 to 76 {\%} had no effect on fecundity at 25-26 °C. CONCLUSIONS We discuss the implications of these results on tsetse SIT-based control programmes.},

abstract = {Male Glossina morsitans morsitans Westwood and Glossina pallidipes Austen caught in artificial refuges in Zimbabwe had ca. six times as much haematin and up to 32{\%} more fat than flies from odour-baited traps, but haematin-specific fat levels did not differ significantly between methods. G. pallidipes estimated to have fed {\textless} 9 h prior to sampling contained ca. 3.3 mg fat - only 10{\%} less than peak levels. A differential equation model for blood-meal metabolism was developed which described well the changes in fat levels of laboratory G. m. morsitans and the relationship between fat and log haematin in field data. The model predicts a mean feeding interval (T) of 54 - 65 h and mean fat levels of ca. 2.8 mg for G. pallidipes at feeding. When haematin frequency data were analysed as suggested in the literature, estimates of feeding rates and intervals, and of the non-feeding phase, varied with sampling method. Published estimates of activitv levels related to feeding suggest a model where feeding rates increase approximately linearly during the trophic cycle. For T 58 h the model gives good predictions of mean fat levels and variances in both species, with starvation rates {\textless} 1 {\%} /day. Models with long non- feeding phases predict fat levels up to 40{\%} lower than observed and with smaller variances. For constant feeding rates, fat levels were well predicted for T = 54 h, but predicted death rates ({\textgreater} 5{\%}/day due to starvation alone) were impossibly high. It is suggested that a proportion of tsetse flies with high fat levels feed on mobile hosts early in the trophic cycle and that this effect is more marked for G. m. morsitans than for G. pallidipes. Over-estimates of T result from the failure to consider these tsetse flies and not to errors in the assumed time scale, nor failure to catch high-fat tsetse flies which visit stationary traps.},

abstract = {Systems analysis and simulation modelling were applied to describe the quantitative epidemiology of trypanosomiasis. With the aid of a causal loop diagram, and based on mechanistic decomposition of the components of the trypanosomiasis-tsetse complex, a Forrester flow diagram was developed. Interactions between factors in the system and variables required in the model were estimated from existing data. Appropriate differential equations were set up to describe the dynamics of the model based on mass action theory. Simulation involved integrating birth and death rates, infection and population dynamics as they relate to the carrying capacity of the land, and fluctuations in temperature and rainfall. Both deterministic and stochastic aspects were considered. The model was computerized using a continuous systems modelling program and integration time intervals of one day. Simulations were run using various initial conditions as provided by data from southwestern Ethiopia. The performance of the model was satisfactory when compared with an independent set of data. The procedure enhanced our understanding of the dynamics of the trypanosomiasis-tsetse complex; it could thus be used as a guide to evaluating different programs to control trypanosomiasis in Ethiopia and in other African countries. {\textcopyright} 1983.},

abstract = {Since Smith and Fretwell's seminal article in 1974 on the optimal offspring size, most theory has assumed a trade-off between offspring number and offspring fitness, where larger offspring have better survival or fitness, but with diminishing returns. In this article, we use two ubiquitous biological mechanisms to derive the shape of this trade-off: the offspring's growth rate combined with its size-dependent mortality (predation). For a large parameter region, we obtain the same sigmoid relationship between offspring size and offspring survival as Smith and Fretwell, but we also identify parameter regions where the optimal offspring size is as small or as large as possible. With increasing growth rate, the optimal offspring size is smaller. We then integrate our model with strategies of parental care. Egg guarding that reduces egg mortality favors smaller or larger offspring, depending on how mortality scales with size. For live-bearers, the survival of offspring to birth is a function of maternal survival; if the mother's survival increases with her size, then the model predicts that larger mothers should produce larger offspring. When using parameters for Trinidadian guppies Poecilia reticulata, differences in both growth and size-dependent predation are required to predict observed differences in offspring size between wild populations from high- and low-predation environments.},

Larvae successfully survived on all host plants. The developmental time of immature stages ranged from 15.03 +/- 0.15 d on Hayula(420) to 16.65 +/- 0.29 d on Opera, with a larval period ranging from 7.67 to 8.91 d on these cultivars.

Life table entropy values (H {\textless} 0.5) indicated Deevey's type I survivorship curve; however, the value of 0.541 on Hayula420 (H {\textgreater} 0.5) corresponded to type III. Major mortality parameters such as fraction of original cohort dying between successive days of age, death frequency (d(x)) of immature P. xylostella, average daily mortality ((mu) over bar), and central death rate (m,,) were evaluated on canola cultivars and indicated that the highest m(x) occurred on RGS(003), with relatively low potential of population growth, on fifth day of life when the pest is in early larval stages (L1 and L2). The early instars are the most susceptible stages and suffer the highest cause-specific mortality under laboratory conditions.},

abstract = {Trypanosomiasis remains one of the most serious constraints to economic development in sub-Saharan Africa and, as a consequence, related research has been subject to strong social and political as well as scientific influences. The epidemics of sleeping sickness that occurred at the turn of the 20th Century focussed research efforts on what became known as 'the colonial disease'. This focus is thought to have produced 'vertical' health services aimed at this one disease, while neglecting other important health issues. Given the scale of these epidemics, and the fact that the disease is fatal if left untreated, it is unsurprising that sleeping sickness dominated colonial medicine. Indeed, recent evidence indicates that, if anything, the colonial authorities greatly under-estimated the mortality attributable to sleeping sickness. Differences in approach to disease control between Francophone and Anglophone Africa, which in the past have been considered ideological, on examination prove to be logical, reflecting the underlying epidemiological divergence of East and West Africa. These epidemiological differences are ancient in origin, pre-dating the colonial period, and continue to the present day. Recent research has produced control solutions, for the African trypanosomiases of humans and livestock, that are effective, affordable and sustainable by small-holder farmers. Whether these simple solutions are allowed to fulfil their promise and become fully integrated into agricultural practice remains to be seen. After more than 100 years of effort, trypanosomiasis control remains a controversial topic, subject to the tides of fashion and politics.},

Concurrently, adults of both species which emerged from locally-collected puparia were marked and released. Recaptures from artificial refuges, odour attractants and mobile baits at periods up to 59 days after release and at distances up to 1800 m from the release site indicated no clear differences between native G. morsitans and the two laboratory-reared groups in respect of body size, amount of fat present at emergence, survival, dispersal, availability to a range of baits, diet, speed of taking a first meal, wing damage and insemination rate. Although the blood-meal identifications for marked female G. morsitans were similar to those for both sexes of unmarked flies, blood-meals from marked males showed a relatively high proportion of bovid identifications. Unmarked flies caught were generally older than marked catches. The ratio of females to males in unmarked samples (1:1 for G. morsitans, 2:1 for G. pallidipes) was roughly double that in marked catches.},

abstract = {Two models have been proposed to explain age-related changes in reproductive performance. State-dependent models predict that reproductive effort depends on the magnitude of surplus energy reserves, which often varies with age. Contrary to this prediction, there was no significant effect of starvation on the outcome of contests for carcasses by female Nicrophorus orbicollis despite weight loss by starved females relative to controls. The residual reproductive value (RRV) model predicts that individuals adjust their current reproductive effort based on potential for future reproduction. Younger adults are predicted to restrain reproductive effort because they are less willing to risk their potentially longer reproductive careers. This model was tested empirically for several components of reproduction. Age was found to be strongly correlated with dominance when two similarly sized females discovered a carcass on the same day. Age also had a small positive effect on egg mass and was positively correlated with ovipositing at least one egg. Age did not affect nesting performance (the degree of carcass burial or the value of a prepared carcass for another female). Age also had no effect on fecundity when a female bred alone but was an important factor when two females were in direct competition. Changing RRV related to aging appears to be a robust determinant of contest outcomes in burying beetles, but effects on other components of reproductive effort in the present and previous studies are more variable, perhaps because of effects of changing state.},

abstract = {SYNOPSIS. Cryoprotectants were tested in both complex and semidefined media for the trypanosomatid Crithidia fasciculata. Near log‐phase or end‐of‐log‐phase cultures were frozen for 24–48 hr at ∼ ‐20 C, then warmed in air to room temperature. Immediate motility was correlated with viability. The best protectant of the 83 tested was glycerol at ∼ 10{\%} (w/v). Survival without cryoprotectant was rare. Outstanding cryoprotectants (perhaps also useful solvents for drugs poorly soluble in water) were: ethylene glycol; 2,2′‐dioxyethanol (diethylene glycol); 1,2,4‐butanetriol; 1,4‐cyclohexanediol; dimethylsulfoxide; propylene glycol; and N‐acetylethanolamine. Several sugars were active, e.g., D‐arabinose, sucrose, and sorbitol. Trypanosomes tolerated cryoprotectants much less; tolerance was better in growth media than in suspension media. Trypanosoma gambiense was grown in blood‐enriched media + 2‐2.5{\%} glycerol, suspended in 20{\%} (w/v) glycerol. then frozen; this permitted 3‐week survival. T. conorhini survived 4 weeks after growth in media containing glycerol 2.5{\%}+ ethylene glycol 4{\%}+ rutin 1.0 mg per 100 ml. Copyright {\textcopyright} 1968, Wiley Blackwell.

Here, we have explored the feasibility of using commercially available LAMP kits, designed to detect the Trypanozoon group of trypanosomes, as a xenomonitoring tool to screen tsetse flies for trypanosomes to be used in future epidemiological surveys.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS AND FINDINGS: The DNA extraction method was simplified and worked with the LAMP kits to detect a single positive fly when pooled with 19 negative flies, and the absolute lowest limit of detection that the kits were able to work at was the equivalent of 0.1 trypanosome per ml. The DNA from Trypanosoma brucei brucei could be detected six days after the fly had taken a blood meal containing dead trypanosomes, and when confronted with a range of non-target species, from both laboratory-reared flies and wild-caught flies, the kits showed no evidence of cross-reacting.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: We have shown that it is possible to use a simplified DNA extraction method in conjunction with the pooling of tsetse flies to decrease the time it would take to screen large numbers of flies for the presence of Trypanozoon trypanosomes. The use of commercially-available LAMP kits provides a reliable and highly sensitive tool for xenomonitoring and identifying potential sleeping sickness transmission sites.},

abstract = {Flies have some of the most elaborate visual systems in the Insecta, often featuring large, sexually dimorphic eyes with specialized “bright zones” that may have a functional role during mate-seeking behavior. The fast visual system of flies is considered to be an adaptation in support of their advanced flight abilities. Here, we show that the immense processing speed of the flies' photoreceptors plays a crucial role in mate recognition. Video-recording wing movements of abdomen-mounted common green bottle flies, Lucilia sericata, under direct light at 15,000 frames per second revealed that wing movements produce a single, reflected light flash per wing beat. Such light flashes were not evident when we video-recorded wing movements under diffuse light. Males of L. sericata are strongly attracted to wing flash frequencies of 178 Hz, which are characteristic of free-flying young females (prospective mates), significantly more than to 212, 235, or 266 Hz, characteristic of young males, old females, and old males, respectively. In the absence of phenotypic traits of female flies, and when given a choice between light emitting diodes that emitted either constant light or light pulsed at a frequency of 110, 178, 250, or 290 Hz, males show a strong preference for the 178-Hz pulsed light, which most closely approximates the wing beat frequency of prospective mates. We describe a previously unrecognized visual mate recognition system in L. sericata. The system depends upon the sex- and age-specific frequencies of light flashes reflecting off moving wings, and the ability of male flies to distinguish between the frequency of light flashes produced by rival males and prospective mates. Our findings imply that insect photoreceptors with fast processing speed may not only support agile flight with advanced maneuverability but may also play a supreme role in mate recognition. The low mating propensity of L. sericata males on cloudy days, when light flashes from the wings of flying females are absent, seems to indicate that these flies synchronize sexual communication with environmental conditions that optimize the conspicuousness of their communication signals, as predicted by sensory drive theory.},

These drugs are distributed to DECs solely by WHO. Drugs are also provided to non-DECs when an HAT case is diagnosed. However, in non-DEC pentamidine can also be purchased in the market due to its indication to treat Pneumocystis and Leishmania infections. Any request for drugs from non-DECs should be accompanied by epidemiological and clinical data on the patient.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: During the period 2000 to 2010, 94 cases of HAT were reported in 19 non-DECs. Seventy-two percent of them corresponded to the Rhodesiense form, whereas 28{\%} corresponded to the Gambiense. Cases of Rhodesiense HAT were mainly diagnosed in tourists after short visits to DECs, usually within a few days of return. The majority of them were in first stage. Initial misdiagnosis with malaria or tick-borne diseases was frequent. Cases of Gambiense HAT were usually diagnosed several months after initial examination and subsequent to a variety of misdiagnoses. The majority were in second stage. Patients affected were expatriates living in DECs for extended periods and refugees or economic migrants from DECs.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: The risk of HAT in travelers and migrants, albeit low, cannot be overlooked. In non-DECs, rarity, nonspecific symptoms, and lack of knowledge and awareness in health staff make diagnosis difficult. Misdiagnosis is frequent, thus leading to invasive diagnosis methods, unnecessary treatments, and increased risk of fatality. Centralized distribution of drugs for HAT by WHO enables an HAT surveillance system for non-DECs to be maintained. This system provides valuable information on disease transmission and complements data collected in DECs.},

Although moisture is important for tsetse population dynamics, evolutionary responses of Glossina water balance to climate have been relatively poorly explored and earlier studies may have been confounded by several factors. Here, using a physiological and GIS climate database, we investigate potential interspecific relationships between traits of water balance and climate. We do so in conventional and phylogenetically independent approaches for both adults and pupae. Results showed that water loss rates (WLR) were significantly positively related to precipitation in pupae even after phylogenetic adjustment. Adults showed no physiology-climate correlations. Ancestral trait reconstruction suggests that a reduction in WLR and increased size probably evolved from an intermediate ancestral state and may have facilitated survival in xeric environments. The results of this study therefore suggest an important role for water balance physiology of pupae in determining interspecific variation and lend support to conclusions reached by early studies of tsetse physiology. {\textcopyright} 2008 The Royal Society.},

Aqueous extracts of corpora cardiaca, midbrain, or thoracic ganglion stimulated the release of radiolabelled material from prelabelled fat cells in vitro. Corpora cardiaca extracts were the most active, approx. 1 × 10-3 gland pairs/$\mu$l elicited the maximal response. At concentrations above 1 × 10-3 gland pairs/$\mu$l the activity of corpora cardiaca extracts was inhibited by a substance which could be removed by gel filtration. The stimulatory factor in nervous-tissue extracts was destroyed by proteolytic enzymes and was recoverable in a single peak by Sephadex G15 gel filtration. Results suggest that it is a peptide hormone produced mainly by the median neurosecretory cells of the midbrain with the corpora cardiaca being the site of storage and release. No hormone was detectable in fresh haemolymph, but it was found at high concentration in boiled haemolymph, implying the presence of a heat labile inhibitor. Under the in vitro conditions used the hormone stimulated the synthesis of proline from alanine and the hydrolysis of triglycerides to free fatty acids. The probable functions of the hormone are to stimulate proline synthesis in response to demand for flight and/or to mobilise lipid for larval nutrition.

abstract = {Modern infectious disease epidemiology builds on two independently developed fields: classical epidemiology and dynamical epidemiology. Over the past decade, integration of the two fields has increased in research practice, but training options within the fields remain distinct with few opportunities for integration in the classroom. The annual Clinic on the Meaningful Modeling of Epidemiological Data (MMED) at the African Institute for Mathematical Sciences has begun to address this gap. MMED offers participants exposure to a broad range of concepts and techniques from both epidemiological traditions. During MMED 2010 we developed a pedagogical approach that bridges the traditional distinction between classical and dynamical epidemiology and can be used at multiple educational levels, from high school to graduate level courses. The approach is hands-on, consisting of a real-time simulation of a stochastic outbreak in course participants, including realistic data reporting, followed by a variety of mathematical and statistical analyses, stemming from both epidemiological traditions. During the exercise, dynamical epidemiologists developed empirical skills such as study design and learned concepts of bias while classical epidemiologists were trained in systems thinking and began to understand epidemics as dynamic nonlinear processes. We believe this type of integrated educational tool will prove extremely valuable in the training of future infectious disease epidemiologists. We also believe that such interdisciplinary training will be critical for local capacity building in analytical epidemiology as Africa continues to produce new cohorts of well-trained mathematicians, statisticians, and scientists. And because the lessons draw on skills and concepts from many fields in biology-from pathogen biology, evolutionary dynamics of host-pathogen interactions, and the ecology of infectious disease to bioinformatics, computational biology, and statistics-this exercise can be incorporated into a broad array of life sciences courses.

These diseases are often zoonoses associated with wilderness areas, and established methods of vector control used in domestic settings (e.g., indoor-residual spraying, insecticide-treated bednets) are therefore inappropriate. Similar difficulties are also emerging with the control of 'old' vector-borne diseases such as malaria. Understanding the host-finding behaviour of vectors assists the development and application of control methods and aids the understanding of epidemiology. Some general lessons are illustrated by reference to a century of research on the host-finding behaviour of tsetse flies which transmit trypanosomes causing human and animal trypanosomiases, including Rhodesian sleeping sickness, a zoonosis associated with wilderness areas of sub-Saharan Africa.},

abstract = {Tsetse flies (Diptera: Glossinidae) are vectors of several species of African trypanosomes pathogenic to both man and his domesticated animals. The diseases they cause continue to have a devastating impact at the level of individual lives and the development of the entire African continent. Understanding the key molecular interactions between the trypanosome parasite and its tsetse fly host may enable more effective control strategies. We are now entering a new, exciting phase for such studies because four key trypanosome genomes are in the final stages of sequencing, assembly and annotation, the tsetse symbiont genomes are available and the Glossina genome is in the latter stages of sequencing. To exploit this information to its fullest extent it is essential that all groups of researchers, those studying trypanosomes, the symbionts and those studying tsetse flies, fully understand the biology of all component parts of the interaction. In addition there are very few entomology laboratories working in this area and more need to be recruited if discovery is to proceed at a good pace. To help achieve both aims, we here outline tsetse-trypanosome interactions from an entomological viewpoint. The trypanosome parasite faces a number of barriers to establishment, survival and maturation within the fly host. In particular, we describe how the tsetse midgut environment, the fly immune system and the fly's symbiotic bacteria contribute to these barriers.},

abstract = {Although variation in mortality is considered by virtually all vector-borne disease specialists to be one of the most important determinants of an arthropod's capacity to transmit pathogens, the operational assumption often is that insect vector mortality is independent of age. Acceptance of the non-senescence assumption leads to the erroneous conclusion that mosquito age is unimportant, results in misleading predictions regarding disease reductions after vector control, and represses study of other aspects of mosquito biology that change with age. We brought large-scale laboratory life table techniques (N {\textgreater} 100,000) to bear on the question of age-dependent mortality in the mosquito vector of dengue virus, Aedes aegypti. Mortality was highly age dependent in both sexes. Mortality was low at young ages ({\textless} 10 days old), steadily increased at middle ages, and decelerated at older ages. A newly derived age-dependent model of pathogen transmission shows the importance of young mosquitoes and population age structure to transmission dynamics. Departure from the age-independent mortality paradigm encourages research on overlooked complexities in mosquito biology, the need for innovative methods to study mosquito population dynamics, and the need to study age-dependent changes for an accurate understanding of mosquito biology and pathogen transmission.},

abstract = {Background: Glossina fuscipes fuscipes is the main vector of human and animal trypanosomiasis in Africa, particularly in Uganda. Attempts to control/eradicate this species using biological methods require knowledge of its reproductive biology. An important aspect is the number of times a female mates in the wild as this influences the effective population size and may constitute a critical factor in determining the success of control methods. To date, polyandry in G.f. fuscipes has not been investigated in the laboratory or in the wild. Interest in assessing the presence of remating in Ugandan populations is driven by the fact that eradication of this species is at the planning stage in this country. Methodology/Principal Findings: Two well established populations, Kabukanga in the West and Buvuma Island in Lake Victoria, were sampled to assess the presence and frequency of female remating. Six informative microsatellite loci were used to estimate the number of matings per female by genotyping sperm preserved in the female spermathecae. The direct count of the minimum number of males that transferred sperm to the spermathecae was compared to Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian probability estimates. The three estimates provided evidence that remating is common in the populations but the frequency is substantially different: 57{\%} in Kabukanga and 33{\%} in Buvuma. Conclusions/Significance: The presence of remating, with females maintaining sperm from different mates, may constitute a critical factor in cases of re-infestation of cleared areas and/or of residual populations. Remating may enhance the reproductive potential of re-invading propagules in terms of their effective population size. We suggest that population age structure may influence remating frequency. Considering the seasonal demographic changes that this fly undergoes during the dry and wet seasons, control programmes based on SIT should release large numbers of sterile males, even in residual surviving target populations, in the dry season. {\textcopyright} 2011 Bonomi et al.},

abstract = {A compartmental model of Gambian sleeping sickness is described that takes into account density-dependent migratory flows of infected flies. Equilibrium and stability theorems are given which show that with a basic reproduction number R0 below unity, then in the absence of reinvasion the disease goes to extinction. However, even a low prevalence rate among reinvading flies can then bring about significant equilibrium prevalence rates among humans. For a set of realistic parameter values we show that even in the case of a virulent parasite that keeps infected individuals in the first stage for as little as 4 or 8 months (durations for which there would be extinction with no infected reinvading flies) there is a prevalence rate in the range 13.0-36.9{\%}, depending on whether 1 or 2{\%} of reinvading flies are infected. A rate of convergence of the population dynamics is introduced and is interpreted in terms of a halving time of the infected population. It is argued that the persistence and/or extension of Gambian sleeping sickness foci could be due either to a continuous reinvasion of infected flies or to slow dynamics.},

For mature male and female adult G. m. morsitans mean temperature (Tbar) accounted for 70 and 50{\%}, respectively, of the variance in mark-recapture estimates of survival when the flies were not subjected to trapping. Saturation deficit (SD) only accounted for 36 and 33{\%}, respectively. Maximum temperature (Tmax) and SD accounted for 36-42{\%} of the variance in male and female G. pallidipes. For the corresponding Moran curve estimates of the survival over all developmental stages, SD lagged by three weeks accounted for 61 and 41{\%} of the variance for male and female G. m. morsitans, respectively, and 64 and 56{\%} for G. pallidipes. The corresponding figures for plots against Tmax were 44, 23, 23, and 21{\%}, respectively. The same patterns were seen in the whole data set once allowance was made for the effect of trapping on survival and for an effect of season, correlated with an index of photosynthetic activity. For male G. m. morsitans there was a significant effect of saturation deficit, but not temperature, on immature survival. Decreased adult survival at high temperatures results from the need to feed more frequently and hence to take more risks per unit time. High saturation deficits result directly in reduced emergence of healthy flies from pupae.},

abstract = {The sexual behaviour of males of Glossina pallidipes Aust. from the Kibwezi Forest and Lambwe Valley in Kenya was investigated in the laboratory. Most observations were on the Kibwezi strain. Three copulatory phases were recognised, marked by male courtship, female buzzing and male jerking with ejaculation. Maturation of copulatory behaviour occurred in advance of ability to inseminate. All males copulated by day 10 and all copulating males inseminated by day 12. Insemination took place only if the jerking phase was present, but neither the occurrence of this phase nor the ejection of a spermatophore proved that insemination had taken place. The degree of insemination showed no general relation to age in previously unmated males. The jerking phase was generally shorter in non-inseminating than in inseminating copulations, although duration of copulation showed no obvious relation to the frequency and degree of insemination. The duration of copulation decreased with increasing age of previously unmated males between 10 and 30 days old. Copulation duration was strain-specific while the jerking phase duration was not, suggesting that the length of the pretransmission period (courtship phase plus female buzzing phase) is strain-dependent. In Kibwezi Forest, sexually appetitive (head-down) behaviour among males caught off a moving vehicle was, in general, not observed among teneral and old males. Head-up and head-down males had small and large amounts of abdominal fat-body, respectively, and both had little gut content. Head-down males exhibited comparatively low activity at dawn and dusk and relatively high midday activity. The findings are discussed in relation to the laboratory rearing of G. pallidipes},

Some 45-60{\%} of resighted flies were seen on decoys, the precentage being greater for flies released at an older age. For flies release on emergence, the mean age at first contact with decoys on a static screen was 6.6 days, an average of 4 days later than their first observed contact with a bait ox. There was great variability in the response towards decoys on sucessive contacts. In general, the intensity of the responses to decoys in the first minute after contact (the 'pre-copulatory' responses) decreased from one encounter to the next in a single 1- to 2-h observation session, but were restored to high levels after an interval of several hours. The intensity of responses towards decoys after this initial period (the 'copulatory' responses) were not affected by previous contacts. Neither previous sexual experience nor age at first contact affected the durations of response on decoys. There were no differences between the responses of wild flies and those from a laboratory colony. The results are discussed in relation to the use with chemosterilant for tsetse autosterilization. Over 60{\%} of flies contacting decoys did so more than once, which would increase, cumulatively, the chances of their being sterilized},

abstract = {The gambiense form of sleeping sickness is a neglected tropical disease, which is presumed to be anthroponotic. However, the parasite persists in human populations at levels of considerable rarity and as such the existence of animal reservoirs has been posited. Clarifying the impact of animal host reservoirs on the feasibility of interrupting sleeping sickness transmission through interventions is a matter of urgency. We developed a mathematical model allowing for heterogeneous exposure of humans to tsetse, with animal populations that differed in their ability to transmit infections, to investigate the effectiveness of two established techniques, screening and treatment of at-risk populations, and vector control. Importantly, under both assumptions, an integrated approach of human screening and vector control was supported in high transmission areas. However, increasing the intensity of vector control was more likely to eliminate transmission, while increasing the intensity of human screening reduced the time to elimination. Non-human animal hosts played important, but different roles in HAT transmission, depending on whether or not they contributed as reservoirs. If they did not serve as reservoirs, sensitivity analyses suggested their attractiveness may instead function as a sink for tsetse bites. These outcomes highlight the importance of understanding the ecological and environmental context of sleeping sickness in optimizing integrated interventions, particularly for moderate and low transmission intensity settings.},

Over 10 000 cattle mortalities were reported in the 1990 nagana outbreak. Although information on the distribution and abundance of the tsetse flies Glossina brevipalpis and Glossina austeni in KwaZulu-Natal exists, data on their vector competence are lacking. This study aimed to determine the rate of natural Trypanosoma congolense infection by field-collected as well as colony-reared flies of these species. A total of 442 field-collected G. brevipalpis and 40 G. austeni flies were dissected immediately after collection to determine their infection rates, whilst 699 G. brevipalpis and 49 G. austeni flies were fed on susceptible animals in 10 and four batches, respectively, for use in xenodiagnosis experiments. Teneral colony flies were fed on infected animals and dissected 21 days post infection to confirm their infectivity testing. Glossina austeni harboured 8{\%} immature and mature infections. In G. brevipalpis, the infection with the immature stages was lower (1{\%}) and no mature infections were observed. Although all four batches of G. austeni transmitted T. congolense to four susceptible animals, no transmission resulted from 10 batches of G. brevipalpis fed on susceptible cattle. Colony-derived G. austeni (534) and G. brevipalpis (882) were fed on four bovines infected with different T. congolense isolates. Both G. austeni and G. brevipalpis acquired trypanosome infection from the bovines, with immature infection ranges of 20{\%} – 33{\%} and 1{\%} – 4{\%}, respectively. Parasites, however, only matured in G. austeni (average = 4{\%}). Glossina austeni plays a larger role in the epidemiology of animal trypanosomosis in KwaZulu-Natal than G. brevipalpis and therefore more focus should be aimed at the former when control measures are implemented.},

This methodological pipeline identifies isolated habitat by first identifying environmental parameters correlated with genetic differentiation, second, predicting spatial connectivity using field-survey observations and the most predictive environmental parameter(s), and third, overlaying the connectivity surface onto a habitat suitability map. Results from this pipeline indicated that net photosynthesis was the strongest predictor of genetic differentiation in G. f. fuscipes in northern Uganda. The resulting connectivity surface identified a large area of well-connected habitat in northwestern Uganda, and twenty-four isolated patches on the northeastern margin of the G. f. fuscipes distribution. We tested this novel methodological pipeline by completing an ad hoc sample and genetic screen of G. f. fuscipes samples from a model-predicted isolated patch, and evaluated whether the ad hoc sample was in fact as genetically isolated as predicted. Results indicated that genetic isolation of the ad hoc sample was as genetically isolated as predicted, with differentiation well above estimates made in samples from within well-connected habitat separated by similar geographic distances. This work has important practical implications for the control of tsetse and other disease vectors, because it provides a way to identify isolated populations where it will be safer and easier to implement vector control and that should be prioritized as study sites during the development and improvement of vector control methods.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 The Author(s). Background: Tsetse flies occur in much of sub-Saharan Africa where they are vectors of trypanosomes that cause human and animal African trypanosomosis. The sterile insect technique (SIT) is currently used to eliminate tsetse fly populations in an area-wide integrated pest management (AW-IPM) context in Senegal and Ethiopia. Three Glossina palpalis gambiensis strains [originating from Burkina Faso (BKF), Senegal (SEN) and an introgressed strain (SENbkf)] were established and are now available for use in future AW-IPM programmes against trypanosomes in West Africa. For each strain, knowledge of the environmental survival thresholds is essential to determine which of these strains is best suited to a particular environment or ecosystem, and can therefore be used effectively in SIT programmes. Methods: In this paper, we investigated the survival and fecundity of three G. p. gambiensis strains maintained under various conditions: 25 °C and 40, 50, 60, and 75 {\%} relative humidity (rH), 30 °C and 60 {\%} rH and 35 °C and 60 {\%} rH. Results: The survival of the three strains was dependent on temperature only, and it was unaffected by changing humidity within the tested range. The BKF strain survived temperatures above its optimum better than the SEN strain. The SENbkf showed intermediate resistance to high temperatures. A temperature of about 32 °C was the limit for survival for all strains. A rH ranging from 40 to 76 {\%} had no effect on fecundity at 25-26 °C. Conclusions: We discuss the implications of these results on tsetse SIT-based control programmes.},

abstract = {This study aims to provide trypanosomiasis-affected countries with standardized datasets and methodologies for mapping the habitat of the tsetse fly (Glossina spp., the disease vector) by customizing and integrating state-of-the-art land cover maps on different spatial scales. Using a combination of inductive and deductive approaches, land cover and fly distribution maps are analysed in a geographic information system (GIS) to estimate the suitability of different land cover units for the three groups (subgenera) of Glossina. All land cover datasets used for and produced by the study comply with the Land Cover Classification System (LCCS). At the continental scale, a strong correlation between land cover and tsetse habitat is found for both the fusca and palpalis groups, whereas a weaker correlation found for the morsitans group may be indicative of less restrictive ecological requirements. At the regional and national levels, thematic aggregation of the multi-purpose Africover datasets yielded high-resolution, standardized land cover maps tailored for tsetse habitat for eight East African countries. The national maps provide remarkable spatial resolution, thematic detail and geographical coverage. They may be applied in subsequent phases of tsetse and trypanosomiasis control projects, including the planning of entomological surveys, actual tsetse control operations and planning for land use in reclaimed areas. The methodology and datasets discussed in the paper may have applications beyond the tsetse and trypanosomiasis issue and may be used with reference to other arthropod vectors, vector-borne and parasitic diseases.},

abstract = {Sleeping sickness describes two diseases, both fatal if left untreated: (i) Gambian sleeping sickness caused by Trypanosoma brucei gambiense, a chronic disease with average infection lasting around 3 years, and (ii) Rhodesian sleeping sickness caused by T. b. rhodesiense, an acute disease with death occurring within weeks of infection. Control of Gambian sleeping sickness is based on case detection and treatment involving serological screening, followed by diagnostic confirmation and staging. In stage I, patients can remain asymptomatic as trypanosomes multiply in tissues and body fluids; in stage II, trypanosomes cross the blood-brain barrier, enter the central nervous system and, if left untreated, death follows. Staging is crucial as it defines the treatment that is prescribed; for both forms of disease, stage II involves the use of the highly toxic drug melarsoprol or, in the case of Gambian sleeping sickness, the use of complex and very expensive drug regimes. Case detection of T. b. gambiense sleeping sickness is known to be inefficient but could be improved by the identification of parasites using molecular tools that are, as yet, rarely used in the field. Diagnostics are not such a problem in relation to T. b. rhodesiense sleeping sickness, but the high level of under-reporting of this disease suggests that current strategies, reliant on self-reporting, are inefficient.Sleeping sickness is one of the 'neglected tropical diseases' that attracts little attention from donors or policymakers. Proper quantification of the burden of sleeping sickness matters, as the primary reason for its 'neglect' is that the true impact of the disease is unknown, largely as a result of under-reporting. Certainly, elimination will not be achieved without vast improvements in field diagnostics for both forms of sleeping sickness especially if there is a hidden reservoir of 'chronic carriers'. Mass screening would be a desirable aim for Gambian sleeping sickness and could be handled on a national scale in the endemic countries - perhaps by piggybacking on programmes committed to other diseases. As well as improved diagnostics, the search for non-toxic drugs for stage II treatment should remain a research priority.There is good evidence that thorough active case finding is sufficient to control T. b. gambiense sleeping sickness, as there is no significant animal reservoir. Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense sleeping sickness is a zoonosis and control involves interrupting the fly-animal-human cycle, so some form of tsetse control and chemotherapy of the animal reservoir must be involved. The restricted application of insecticide to cattle is the most promising, affordable and sustainable technique to have emerged for tsetse control. Animal health providers can aid disease control by treating cattle and, when allied with innovative methods of funding (e.g. public-private partnerships) not reliant on the public purse, this approach may prove more sustainable.Sleeping sickness incidence for the 36 endemic countries has shown a steady decline in recent years and we should take advantage of the apparent lull in incidence and aim for elimination. This is feasible in some sleeping sickness foci but must be planned and paid for increasingly by the endemic countries themselves. The control and elimination of T. b. gambiense sleeping sickness may be seen as a public good, as appropriate strategies depend on local health services for surveillance and treatment, but public-private funding mechanisms should not be excluded. It is timely to take up the tools available and invest in new tools - including novel financial instruments - to eliminate this disease from Africa. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {In sub-Saharan Africa, tsetse (Glossina spp.) transmit species of Trypanosoma which threaten 45-50 million cattle with trypanosomiasis. These livestock are subject to various herding practices which may affect biting rates on individual cattle and hence the probability of infection. In Zimbabwe, studies were made of the effect of herd size and composition on individual biting rates by capturing tsetse as they approached and departed from groups of one to 12 cattle. Flies were captured using a ring of electrocuting nets and bloodmeals were analysed using DNA markers to identify which individual cattle were bitten. Increasing the size of a herd from one to 12 adults increased the mean number of tsetse visiting the herd four-fold and the mean feeding probability from 54{\%} to 71{\%}; the increased probability with larger herds was probably a result of fewer flies per host, which, in turn, reduced the hosts' defensive behaviour. For adults and juveniles in groups of four to eight cattle, {\textgreater} 89{\%} of bloodmeals were from the adults, even when these comprised just 13{\%} of the herd. For groups comprising two oxen, four cows/heifers and two calves, a grouping that reflects the typical composition of communal herds in Zimbabwe, approximately 80{\%} of bloodmeals were from the oxen. Simple models of entomological inoculation rates suggest that cattle herding practices may reduce individual trypanosomiasis risk by up to 90{\%}. These results have several epidemiological and practical implications. First, the gregarious nature of hosts needs to be considered in estimating entomological inoculation rates. Secondly, heterogeneities in biting rates on different cattle may help to explain why disease prevalence is frequently lower in younger/smaller cattle. Thirdly, the cost and effectiveness of tsetse control using insecticide-treated cattle may be improved by treating older/larger hosts within a herd. In general, the patterns observed with tsetse appear to apply to other genera of cattle-feeding Diptera (Stomoxys, Anopheles, Tabanidae) and thus may be important for the development of strategies for controlling other diseases affecting livestock.},

abstract = {The public health benefits of data-sharing have been widely recognized over the past decade. A recent statement signed by over 30 research funders, nongovernmental organizations and publishers highlighted the importance of rapidly sharing information in public health emergencies.1 Several platforms for pre-publication data and manuscripts have been established. This journal has initiated Zika Open, a protocol for immediate posting of research manuscripts submitted in the context of the related public health emergency of international concern. The demands of managing public health emergencies due to infectious disease outbreaks have prompted early sharing of data accruing from outbreak investigation and surveillance and public health-oriented research. Under the auspices of its blueprint for increasing research and development preparedness,2 and responding to the need for rapid and well-informed decision-making in emergencies, the World Health Organization (WHO) has developed a core set of principles for the sharing of data and results during public health emergencies. These principles were developed through an international multisectoral consultation held in Geneva in September, 2015.3 The increased provision of surveillance and research data means that central data repositories, inclusive of data curation services,4 are needed to provide the infrastructure for data sharing. In this editorial, we present a global health-oriented approach to the operation of data platforms, through three operating principles designed to reflect the rights and interests of all stakeholders while protecting the overarching public health objectives of the International Health Regulations (2005). First, all data platforms should have an explicit ethical and legal framework governing data collection and use. The risks of withholding critical data need to be weighed against risks of sharing. Legitimate concerns regarding risks around personal data and the requirements of data protection legislation need to be addressed through reliable anonymization and encryption methods. Legal and ethical considerations also apply to publications and other products developed from the data. Second, results generated from additional analyses should be made public within a reasonable timeframe. The time required may vary depending on the situation, the complexity of the data, and the need for sufficient quality assurance. One perceived impediment to the early sharing of data is that the data providers may earn no credit for their work if analyses are first published by others. WHO considers that health research data are a global public good, but that data providers are also entitled to due credit for their work. Finding an effective way to assign credit and thus protect the interests of data providers – including government agencies, individual scientists, academic institutions and consortia – may determine the success of any data platform. Such recognition may range from acknowledgement to co-authorship or sharing of intellectual property, and should be determined in a fair and systematic fashion. Arrangements that concern data originating from low- and middle-income countries should include plans to build future local capacity for data management and analysis. Third, platform operators should develop and publish terms for data-use, describing how each of the above principles will be applied to the data they receive, host and distribute. These terms should cover management of potential new intellectual property, and describe the process by which access to data is granted. The data platform operators are not the owners of the data, but fulfil important roles of stewardship and service provision. Clinical trials present specific considerations because trial participants accept the unquantifiable risks of research in exchange for advances in knowledge. Ethical principles oblige rapid and full reporting of the data from clinical trials to prevent exposing additional participants to unnecessary risk. This reporting imperative is even more important in the context of a public health emergency. A three-step process for maximizing the utility of information from clinical trials could include universal prospective registration,5 timely public disclosure of results, and timely data sharing. Data platforms can facilitate information sharing, and prior agreement on the principles set out here will speed the flow of information when it is most urgently needed, notably in public health emergencies. When put into practice, these principles will protect individuals' rights while maximising the substantial benefits for public health. WHO encourages all health data providers to adopt these principles and is working with Member States to implement them for data supplied in emergencies.},

abstract = {The control of tsetse fly populations using traps or targets depends on the movement patterns of the flies, which determines how many flies find the traps, and on the efficiency of the traps, which determines the proportion of these flies that are killed. In this paper we develop models to predict population loss rates under various trapping regimes. The parameters in our models are the range of attraction of the traps, the mortality rate imposed by the traps, the rate at which the flies diffuse through an area, the fly population growth rate, and the distribution of the traps or targets. We derive analytical results for two limiting cases: very mobile flies and inefficient traps: relatively immobile flies and very efficient traps. We show that if the flies are very mobile and the traps relatively inefficient, the rate at which the fly population is reduced is limited by the range of attraction, the trapping mortality rate and the population growth rate: if the flies are relatively immobile and the traps very efficient, the rate of reduction is limited by the mobility of the flies and the population growth rate. The actual situation will tie within these limits. Numerical simulations are used to test the validity of the analytical results. Data from field studies in Africa are used to test the predictions of the models and to confirm their validity. We show how the efficiency of barriers constructed from lines of traps or targets depends on the width of the barrier, the mobility of the flies and the mortality rate within the barrier. We calculate the distance beyond the range of attraction of a trap over which the trap will reduce the fly population density significantly. We investigate the relationship between trap catches and population densities and determine the factors that effect the calibration of traps as sampling devices for the two limiting cases. We investigate the rate at which a fly front will advance into country cleared of or previously unoccupied...

The sexual behaviour of male Glossina morsitans morsitans Westwood (Diptera: Glossinidae) towards decoys dosed with sex phero-mone (15,19,23-trimethylheptatriacontane) is described quantitatively from field observations. The flies responded with a standard behavioural pattern after landing. This involved: first, the perception of pheromone; second, orientation on the decoy and genitalia engagement; and third, a lengthy quiescence corresponding to natural copulation. The probability of a fly leaving a decoy decreased during the sequence and was least in the final ‘copulatory' phase, when it remained constant under constant conditions. The initial, rapid rates at which flies left decoys were affected mostly by pheromone dose: the lower the dose, the higher the rate. The final, slow rate of leaving was unaffected by pheromone dose, being most affected by environmental stimuli, especially interference from other flies: at high fly densities, final rates of leaving were high. The results are discussed in the context of improving the potential for using pheromone and chemo-sterilant-dosed decoys for tsetse autosterilization.},

In numerous animals, including humans, reproductive performance decreases with age. Here, we demonstrate that some social insect queens exhibit the opposite pattern. Egg laying rates of Cardiocondyla obscurior ant queens increased with age until death, even when the number of workers caring for them was kept constant. Cardiocondyla, and probably also other ants, therefore resemble the few select organisms with similar age-specific reproductive investment, such as corals, sturgeons, or box turtles (e.g., [1]), but they differ in being more short-lived and lacking individual, though not social, indeterminate growth. Furthermore, in contrast to most other organisms, in which average life span declines with increasing reproductive effort, queens with high egg laying rates survived as long as less fecund queens.},

Missov et al.Background: The Gompertz force of mortality (hazard function) is usually expressed in terms of a, the initial level of mortality, and b, the rate at which mortality increases with age. OBJECTIVE We express the Gompertz force of mortality in terms of b and the old-age modal age at death M, and present similar relationships for other widely-used mortality models. Our objective is to explain the advantages of using the parameterization in terms of M. Methods: Using relationships among life table functions at the modal age at death, we express the Gompertz force of mortality as a function of the old-age mode. We estimate the correlation between the estimators of old (a and b) and new (M and b) parameters from simulated data. RESULTS When the Gompertz parameters are statistically estimated from simulated data, the correlation between estimated values of b and M is much less than the correlation between estimated values of a and b. For the populations in the Human Mortality Database, there is a negative association between a and b and a positive association between M and b.},

abstract = {The evolution of investment per offspring (I) is often viewed through the lens of the classic theory, in which variation among individuals in a population is not expected. A substantial departure from this prediction arises in the form of correlations between maternal body size and I, which are observed within populations in virtually all taxonomic groups. Based on the generality of this observation, we suggest it is caused by a common underlying mechanism. We pursue a unifying explanation for this pattern by reviewing all theoretical models that attempt to explain it. We assess the generality of the mechanism upon which each model is based, and the extent to which data support its predictions. Two classes of adaptive models are identified: models that assume that the correlation arises from maternal influences on the relationship between I and offspring fitness [w(I)], and those that assume that maternal size influences the relationship between I and maternal fitness [W(I)]. The weight of evidence suggests that maternal influences on w(I) are probably not very general, and even for taxa where maternal influences on w(I) are likely, experiments fail to support model predictions. Models that assume that W(I) varies with maternal size appear to offer more generality, but the current challenge is to identify a specific and general mechanism upon which W(I) varies predictably with maternal size. Recent theory suggests the exciting possibility that a yet unknown mechanism modifies the offspring size-number trade-off function in a manner that is predictable with respect to maternal size, such that W(I) varies with size. We identify two promising avenues of inquiry. First, the trade-off might be modified by energetic costs that are associated with the initiation of reproduction ('overhead costs') and that scale with I, and future work could investigate what specific overhead costs are generally associated with reproduction and whether these costs scale with I. Second, the trade-off might be modified by virtue of condition-dependent offspring provisioning coupled with metabolic factors, and future work could investigate the proximate cause of, and generality of, condition-dependent offspring provisioning. Finally, drawing on the existing literature, we suggest that maternal size per se is not causatively related to variation in I, and the mechanism involved in the correlation is instead linked to maternal nutritional status or maternal condition, which is usually correlated with maternal size. Using manipulative experiments to elucidate why females with high nutritional status typically produce large offspring might help explain what specific mechanism underlies the maternal-size correlation.},

The 4-methyl-substituted derivative (2-methoxy-4-methylphenol) was found to elicit stronger repellent responses from the flies compared with guaiacol. None of the other analogues showed significant repellent effects on flies. 4-Methylguaiacol, guaiacol, and eugenol (which was included because of previous reports of its repellency against a number of arthropods) were further evaluated in the field with wild populations of predominantly Glossina pallidipes Austen. The presence of guaiacol or eugenol near odor-baited traps caused some nonsignificant reduction in the number of tsetse catches at relatively high release rates (approximately 50 mg/hr). In contrast, the 4-methyl derivative at three different release rates (2.2, 4.5, and 9.0 mg/hr) reduced trap catches of baited traps in a dose-response manner. At 10 mg/hr release rate, it reduced the catches of baited and unbaited traps by approximately 80 and approximately 70{\%}, respectively. In addition, the compound not only reduced the number of tsetse attracted to natural ox odor (approximately 80{\%}), but also had an effect on their feeding responses, reducing the proportion that fed on an ox by more than 80{\%}. Our study shows that the presence of a methyl substituent at the 4-position of guaiacol enhances the repellency of the molecule to savannah tsetse and suggests that 4-methylguaiacol may represent a promising additional tool in the arsenal of techniques in trypanosomiasis control.},

Those flies whose fat content was raised to higher levels by being fed more frequently performed more flight activity, but all females showed very little activity until day 4 after their last blood meal, thereby using only a small fraction of their fat reserves. This contrasted markedly with the large amount of flight performed by males on day 3, resulting in the depletion of their fat reserves. The difference is interpreted with respect to females flying only to find food approximately once every 3 days (and larviposition sites approximately once every 9 days), compared with males flying to find as many mates as possible during the earlier part of the feeding cycle when their energy reserves are high and feeding is a low priority},

Shoot growth started in the dry season (September-November) and lasted until April during the 1991/92 season but had virtually ceased by January 1993 during the 1992/93 season. The shoot growing season was associated with low foliar N/P ratios. These ratios were much lower ({\textless}5) during the 1991/92 season than in the 1992/93 season (12-15). The increase in foliar N/P ratios after the shoot growing season was caused by a sharp drop in foliar P concentration, apparently due to reabsorption before leaf fall. There were no annual variations in biomass N concentration in contrast to P. During the 1992/93 growing season P concentrations in foliage and wood were a quarter and a third, respectively, of the 1991/92 levels. Since the short shoot growing season observed during the 1992/93 season is typical of savanna woodland trees in southern Africa, the high biomass P concentration and longer growing season in 1991/92 season were exceptional and may have been related to reduced competition by shallow rooting herbaceous plants caused by the severe drought of that season.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The emphasis placed on the activities of mobile teams in the detection of gambiense human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) can at times obscure the major role played by fixed health facilities in HAT control and surveillance. The lack of consistent and detailed data on the coverage of passive case-finding and treatment further constrains our ability to appreciate the full contribution of the health system to the control of HAT.

METHODS: A survey was made of all fixed health facilities that are active in the control and surveillance of gambiense HAT. Information on their diagnostic and treatment capabilities was collected, reviewed and harmonized. Health facilities were geo-referenced. Time-cost distance analysis was conducted to estimate physical accessibility and the potential coverage of the population at-risk of gambiense HAT.

RESULTS: Information provided by the National Sleeping Sickness Control Programmes revealed the existence of 632 fixed health facilities that are active in the control and surveillance of gambiense HAT in endemic countries having reported cases or having conducted active screening activities during the period 2000-2012. Different types of diagnosis (clinical, serological, parasitological and disease staging) are available from 622 facilities. Treatment with pentamidine for first-stage disease is provided by 495 health facilities, while for second-stage disease various types of treatment are available in 206 health facilities only. Over 80{\%} of the population at-risk for gambiense HAT lives within 5-hour travel of a fixed health facility offering diagnosis and treatment for the disease.

CONCLUSIONS: Fixed health facilities have played a crucial role in the diagnosis, treatment and coverage of at-risk-population for gambiense HAT. As the number of reported cases continues to dwindle, their role will become increasingly important for the prospects of disease elimination. Future updates of the database here presented will regularly provide evidence to inform and monitor a rational deployment of control and surveillance efforts. Support to the development and, if successful, the implementation of new control tools (e.g. new diagnostics and new drugs) is crucial, both for strengthening and expanding the existing network of fixed health facilities by improving access to diagnosis and treatment and for securing a sustainable control and surveillance of gambiense HAT.},

abstract = {In tsetse both sexes feed exclusively on the blood of vertebrates for a few minutes every 2-3 days. Tsetse flies seek cover from high temperatures to conserve energy and plants provide shelter for tsetse in all the biotopes they occupy. Recently, tsetse have taken cover in plantations and under the invasive bush Lantana camara that has invaded large areas of the tsetse fly belt of Africa. Flies from such refugia are implicated in sleeping sickness epidemics. In a wind tunnel we show that both foliage and an extract of volatiles from foliage of L. camara attract three tsetse spp. from different habitats: Glossina fuscipes fuscipes (riverine), G. brevipalpis (sylvatic) and G. pallidipes (savannah). Gas chromatography analysis of volatiles extracted from leaves and flowers of L. camara coupled to electroantennograme recordings show that 1-octen-3-ol and $\beta$-caryophyllene are the major chemostimuli for the antennal receptor cells of the three tsetse spp. studied. A binary mixture of these products attracted these flies in the wind tunnel. The gas chromatography linked electroantennograme analysis of the L. camara extracts also show that the antennal receptor cells of the three tsetse spp. respond similarly to groups of volatiles derived from the major biosynthetic and catabolic pathways of plants, i.e. to mono- and sesquiterpenes, to lipoxidation products and to aromatics. Mixtures of these plant volatiles also attracted tsetse in the wind tunnel. These findings show that tsetse flies have conserved a strong sensitivity to volatile secondary products of plants, underlining the fundamental role of vegetation in tsetse survival. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Some freshwater turtles appear unable to produce eggs large enough to achieve the balance between size and number of eggs predicted by optimal egg size theory. We present evidence that pelvic girdle structure constrains egg size and thus offspring size in females of smaller-bodied species (Chrysemys picta and Deirochelys reticularia). The constraint is demonstrated by the correspondence of slopes of the increase of the pelvic aperture and egg width with increasing body size. This constraint appears to be relaxed in a larger-bodied species (Pseudemys scripta), in which the increase in pelvic aperture relative to body size is greater than the increase in egg width. This type of structural constraint on a reproductive trait should not occur unless there is strong selection on pelvic architecture for other functions, such as locomotion, support, and limb retraction, that prevent expansion of the pelvic aperture. Although other explanations may exist for other groups of organisms that appear to vary egg size, the large variation in egg size associated with body size in some species of turtles can be reconciled with optimal egg size theory only if a pelvic constraint model is accepted.},

Responses were measured either by baiting (1.) biconical traps or (2.) electrocuting black targets with natural host odours. The catch of G. tachinoides from traps was significantly enhanced ( approximately 5x) by odour from cattle but not humans. In contrast, catches from electric targets showed inconsistent results. For G. p. gambiensis both human and cattle odour increased ({\textgreater}2x) the trap catch significantly but not the catch from electric targets. For G. p. palpalis, odours from pigs and humans increased (approximately 5x) the numbers of tsetse attracted to the vicinity of the odour source but had little effect on landing or trap-entry. For G. tachinoides a blend of POCA (P = 3-n-propylphenol; O = 1-octen-3-ol; C = 4-methylphenol; A = acetone) alone or synthetic cattle odour (acetone, 1-octen-3-ol, 4-methylphenol and 3-n-propylphenol with carbon dioxide) consistently caught more tsetse than natural cattle odour. For G. p. gambiensis, POCA consistently increased catches from both traps and targets. For G. p. palpalis, doses of carbon dioxide similar to those produced by a host resulted in similar increases in attraction. Baiting traps with super-normal (approximately 500 mg/h) doses of acetone also consistently produced significant but slight (approximately 1.6x) increases in catches of male flies. The results suggest that odour-baited traps and insecticide-treated targets could assist the AU-Pan African Tsetse and Trypanosomiasis Eradication Campaign (PATTEC) in its current efforts to monitor and control Palpalis group tsetse in West Africa. For all three species, only approximately 50{\%} of the flies attracted to the vicinity of the trap were actually caught by it, suggesting that better traps might be developed by an analysis of the visual responses and identification of any semiochemicals involved in short-range interaction.},

abstract = {The dispersal of Glossina species is of interest to pest control personnel since these flies are the biological vectors of human and animal trypanosomes in Africa. The design of control and/or eradication programmes requires an accurate knowledge of the ecological characteristics of tsetse flies and the geographic structure of their populations. The present study attempts to model the dispersal process of a riverine tsetse species, i.e. Glossina palpalis gambiensis Vanderplank in Burkina Faso along an apparent homogeneous gallery forest. While for savannah species, dispersal is usually modelled as a two-dimensional random walk (in time and space) or diffusion (its continuous analogue), for riverine species, dispersal can be viewed more simply as a one-dimensional random walk. The data reported here show that the topology of the habitat, which is a system of tributaries rather than a straight line, has a great impact on the dispersal process. Moreover, since only a part of the river system can be observed in practice, the effect of partial observation when estimating dispersal parameters can be quantified. The results reported here were obtained using a data set from a mark-release-recapture experiment carried out with G. p. gambiensis on a tributary of the Mouhoun River in Burkina Faso. The model was fitted to field data and used to estimate the displacement of a fly during 10{\%} of its lifespan (13 kilometres) and the probability of it dispersing more than 10 kilometres from its initial position ( P {\textgreater} 0.1). The analysis was carried out by either taking into account, or ignoring, the fact that only part of the river system was observed during the mark-releaserecapture protocol.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: In the savannahs of East and Southern Africa, tsetse flies (Glossina spp.) transmit Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense which causes Rhodesian sleeping sickness, the zoonotic form of human African trypanosomiasis. The flies feed mainly on wild and domestic animals and are usually repelled by humans. However, this innate aversion to humans can be undermined by environmental stresses on tsetse populations, so increasing disease risk. To monitor changes in risk, we need traps designed specifically to quantify the responsiveness of savannah tsetse to humans, but the traps currently available are designed to simulate other hosts.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In Zimbabwe, two approaches were made towards developing a man-like trap for savannah tsetse: either modifying an ox-like trap or creating new designs. Tsetse catches from a standard ox-like trap used with and without artificial ox odor were reduced by two men standing nearby, by an average of 34{\%} for Glossina morsitans morsitans and 56{\%} for G. pallidipes, thus giving catches more like those made by hand-nets from men. Sampling by electrocuting devices suggested that the men stopped flies arriving near the trap and discouraged trap-entering responses. Most of human repellence was olfactory, as evidenced by the reduction in catches when the trap was used with the odor of hidden men. Geranyl acetone, known to occur in human odor, and dispensed at 0.2 mg/h, was about as repellent as human odor but not as powerfully repellent as wood smoke. New traps looking and smelling like men gave catches like those from men.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: Catches from the completely new man-like traps seem too small to give reliable indices of human repellence. Better indications would be provided by comparing the catches of an ox-like trap either with or without artificial human odor. The chemistry and practical applications of the repellence of human odor and smoke deserve further study.},

The human disease, sleeping sickness, and the animal disease, nagana, are caused by trypanosomes, protozoan parasites transmitted by tsetse flies, Glossina spp. Attempts have been made to control tsetse and trypanosomiasis for over 70 years, supported by ever-increasing amounts of foreign aid. Although progress has been made in the control of sleeping sickness, this disease still persists in many countries. Nogono excludes cattle from many of the potentially most productive areas of Africa and is a major constraint on economic development.

abstract = {Near infrared (NIR) photography and video was investigated as a method for observing and recording intrapuparial development in the tsetse fly Glossina palpalis gambiensis and other Muscomorpha (Cyclorrhapha) Diptera. We showed that NIR light passes through the puparium, permitting images of the true pupae and pharate adult to be captured. Various wavelengths of NIR light from 880 to 1060 nm were compared to study the development of tsetse fly pupae from larviposition to emergence, using time-lapse videos and photographs. This study was carried out to advance our understanding of tsetse pupal development, specifically with the goal of improving a sorting technique which could separate male from female tsetse flies several days before emergence. Separation of the sexes at this stage is highly desirable for operational tsetse sterile insect technique control programmes, as it would permit the easy retention of females for the colony while allowing the males to be handled, irradiated and shipped in the pupal stage when they are less sensitive to vibration. In addition, it presents a new methodology for studying the pupal stage of many coarctate insects for many applications. NIR imaging permits observation of living pupae, allowing the entire development process to be observed without disruption.},

A modification of mechanical trapping permitted investigation of the pattern in whichtsetse vacated a refuge. Coolness and shade were features of effective refuges. Large numbers of tsetse utilised refuges only during the hot dry months of September, October and November. Entries occurred when temperatures reached 32°C in the morning and continued until mid-afternoon; exits occurred mainly in the evening. G. morsitansentering at 12.00–14.00 h were relatively abundant in fat; G. pallidipes entering at 12.00–16.00 h were relatively abundant in residual blood-meal. Greatest numbers of tsetse occupied refuges in naturally shaded situations such as riverine fringes. Few of the many tsetse marked in refuges and releasedwere found again at the refuge of marking. Artificial refuges were not used extensively for larval deposition. Comparisons between the catches from refuges, oxen, Morris traps and a fly round illustrate the problem of obtaining representative samples of tsetse populations. The application of insecticides to natural refuges is a policy of merit.},

abstract = {Many experiments have shown that foraging animals are sensitive to the riskiness, or variance, associated with alternative food sources. For example, when offered a choice of a constant feeding option that always offers three seeds, and a risky option that offers either no seeds or six seeds with equal probability, most animals tested will be either risk-averse or risk-prone, preferring either the fixed or variable option respectively. Whether animals are risk-averse or risk-prone appears to depend on a range of factors, including the energetic status of the forager, the type of variance associated with the feeding options and even the number of feeding options between which the animal is choosing. These behavioural phenomena have attracted much theoretical interest, and a range of different explanations have been suggested, some based on a consideration ofthe psychological mechanisms involved in decision making, and others on a consideration of the Darwinian fitness consequences of risk-averse or risk-prone behaviour for the forager. A brief review of the recent literature on risk-sensitive foraging will be presented, focusing on results from the two experimental systems with which I have been involved: wild rufous hummingbirds (Selasphorus rufus) foraging on artificial flowers; European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) foraging in operant boxes in the laboratory. It will be argued that to understand the foraging decisions of animals account needs to be taken of both the psychological mechanisms underlying decision-making and the fitness consequences of different decisions for the forager.},

abstract = {The developmental response of insects to temperature is important in understanding the ecology of insect life histories. Temperature-dependent phenology models permit examination of the impacts of temperature on the geographical distributions, population dynamics and management of insects. The measurement of insect developmental, survival and reproductive responses to temperature poses practical challenges because of their modality, variability among individuals and high mortality near the lower and upper threshold temperatures. We address this challenge with an integrated approach to the design of experiments and analysis of data based on maximum likelihood. This approach expands, simplifies and unifies the analysis of laboratory data parameterizing the thermal responses of insects in particular and poikilotherms in general. This approach allows the use of censored observations (records of surviving individuals that have not completed development after a certain time) and accommodates observations from temperature transfer treatments in which individuals pass only a portion of their development at an extreme (near-threshold) temperature and are then placed in optimal conditions to complete their development with a higher rate of survival. Results obtained from this approach are directly applicable to individual-based modeling of insect development, survival and reproduction with respect to temperature. This approach makes possible the development of process-based phenology models that are based on optimal use of available information, and will aid in the development of powerful tools for analyzing eruptive insect population behavior and response to changing climatic conditions. {\textcopyright} 2012.},

We also reanalyzed the data of Erythronium japonicum to test the models. The terminal-stream-limitation model predicted that the optimal offspring size that maximizes the fitness of the mother increases with an increase in the maximum rate of resource extraction by each single offspring. Thus, large mothers produce large offspring if the maximum resource extraction rate is high in those mothers. The upper-stream-limitation model predicted that the optimal offspring size decreases with an increase in the maximum rate of resource supply by the mother to all the offspring. In E. japonicum, the maximum growth rate of a seed was independent of the number of seeds of a plant, suggesting that the resource extraction rate is limited at the individual seed level. The maximum growth rate was high in large plants and had a strong positive effect on final seed mass. Thus, the results were consistent with the terminal-stream-limitation model.},

abstract = { Tsetse flies ( Glossina spp.) are the sole vectors of Trypanosoma brucei —the agent of human (HAT) and animal (AAT) trypanosomiasis. Glossina fuscipes fuscipes ( Gff ) is the main vector species in Uganda—the only country where the two forms of HAT disease ( rhodesiense and gambiense ) occur, with gambiense limited to the northwest. Gff populations cluster in three genetically distinct groups in northern, southern, and western Uganda, respectively, with a contact zone present in central Uganda. Understanding the dynamics of this contact zone is epidemiologically important as the merger of the two diseases is a major health concern. We used mitochondrial and microsatellite DNA data from Gff samples in the contact zone to understand its spatial extent and temporal stability. We show that this zone is relatively narrow, extending through central Uganda along major rivers with south to north introgression but displaying no sex-biased dispersal. Lack of obvious vicariant barriers suggests that either environmental conditions or reciprocal competitive exclusion could explain the patterns of genetic differentiation observed. Lack of admixture between northern and southern populations may prevent the sympatry of the two forms of HAT disease, although continued control efforts are needed to prevent the recolonization of tsetse-free regions by neighboring populations. },

abstract = {Nearly all mathematical models of vector-borne diseases have assumed that vectors die at constant rates. However, recent empirical research suggests that mosquito mortality rates are frequently age dependent. This work develops a simple mathematical model to assess how relaxing the classical assumption of constant mortality affects the predicted effectiveness of anti-vectorial interventions. The effectiveness of mosquito control when mosquitoes die at age dependent rates was also compared across different extrinsic incubation periods. Compared to a more realistic age dependent model, constant mortality models overestimated the sensitivity of disease transmission to interventions that reduce mosquito survival. Interventions that reduce mosquito survival were also found to be slightly less effective when implemented in systems with shorter EIPs. Future transmission models that examine anti-vectorial interventions should incorporate realistic age dependent mortality rates.},

abstract = {AbstractWe conducted simulations to compare the precision and bias of survival estimates from Cormack?Jolly?Seber (CJS) and Barker models to known parameter values based on empirical data for steelhead/resident Rainbow Trout Oncorhynchus mykiss from the John Day River, Oregon. We simulated seasonal differences in recapture and survival rates, and we varied the number of fish tagged, recapture and resight rates, sample site size, and fish movement (migratory or resident). Survival estimates from the Barker model had higher precision and lower or equal bias in comparison with estimates from the CJS model under almost all simulation scenarios. The precision of Barker survival estimates increased the most as the number of tagged fish increased from 50 to 200 (CV = 0.4?0.09). The Barker model's superior performance was dependent on the availability of resight data; such data are becoming more readily available, especially in places where large numbers of individuals are PIT-tagged and where an interrogation infrastructure exists (e.g., Columbia River basin). Tagging of 75?100 fish/site during high-capture periods (e.g., summer and fall) and focusing on the resighting of fish with fixed or mobile interrogators during low-capture periods (i.e., winter and spring) may be the most cost-effective strategy for improving estimates of juvenile steelhead survival.Received April 18, 2014; accepted August 26, 2014},

abstract = {Tsetse flies (Glossina spp.) can harbor up to three distinct species of endosymbiotic bacteria that exhibit unique modes of transmission and evolutionary histories with their host. Two mutualist enterics, Wigglesworthia and Sodalis, are transmitted maternally to tsetse flies' intrauterine larvae. The third symbiont, from the genus Wolbachia, parasitizes developing oocytes. In this study, we determined that Sodalis isolates from several tsetse fly species are virtually identical based on a phylogenetic analysis of their ftsZ gene sequences. Furthermore, restriction fragment-length polymorphism analysis revealed little variation in the genomes of Sodalis isolates from tsetse fly species within different subgenera (Glossina fuscipes fuscipes and Glossina morsitans morsitans). We also examined the impact on host fitness of transinfecting G. fuscipes fuscipes and G. morsitans morsitans flies with reciprocal Sodalis strains. Tsetse flies cleared of their native Sodalis symbionts were successfully repopulated with the Sodalis species isolated from a different tsetse fly species. These transinfected flies effectively transmitted the novel symbionts to their offspring and experienced no detrimental fitness effects compared to their wild-type counterparts, as measured by longevity and fecundity. Quantitative PCR analysis revealed that transinfected flies maintained their Sodalis populations at densities comparable to those in flies harboring native symbionts. Our ability to transinfect tsetse flies is indicative of Sodalis ' recent evolutionary history with its tsetse fly host and demonstrates that this procedure may be used as a means of streamlining future paratransgenesis experiments.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Over the last few years, momentum has gathered around the feasibility and opportunity of eliminating gambiense human African trypanosomiasis (g-HAT). Under the leadership of the World Health Organization (WHO), a large coalition of stakeholders is now committed to achieving this goal. A roadmap has been laid out, and indicators and milestones have been defined to monitor the progress of the elimination of g-HAT as a public health problem by 2020. Subsequently, a more ambitious objective was set for 2030: to stop disease transmission. This paper provides a situational update to 2012 for a number of indicators of elimination: number of cases annually reported, geographic distribution of the disease and areas and populations at different levels of risk.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Comparing the 5-year periods 2003-2007 and 2008-2012, the area at high or very high risk of g-HAT shrank by 60{\%}, while the area at moderate risk decreased by 22{\%}. These are the areas where g-HAT is still to be considered a public health problem (i.e. {\textgreater} 1 HAT reported case per 10,000 people per annum). This contraction of at-risk areas corresponds to a reduction of 57{\%} for the population at high or very high risk (from 4.1 to 1.8 million), and 20{\%} for moderate risk (from 14.0 to 11.3 million).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nDISCUSSION: Improved data completeness and accuracy of the Atlas of HAT enhanced our capacity to monitor the progress towards the elimination of g-HAT. The trends in the selected indicators suggest that, in recent years, progress has been steady and in line with the elimination goal laid out in the WHO roadmap on neglected tropical diseases.},

abstract = {In long-lived snakes estimates of survival rates in the immature age classes are notoriously difficult to obtain because the small, secretive juveniles are rarely caught in field studies. Hence, it is assumed that in many species juveniles suffer high mortality. An alternative view holds that the youngest life stages are so elusive that they ‘disappear' temporarily from the population. We conducted a long-term (2000–2016) mark–recapture study in a large population of European adders (Vipera berus) and obtained demographic data for a large sample of individuals, including respectable numbers of immature and newborn snakes. Estimates obtained by the Cormack–Jolly–Seber method revealed dramatic age-related differences in yearly capture probabilities: they were much lower in the immature classes than in the adults. Concurrently, we found no evidence for age-dependent differences in survival rates. Hence, our inability to capture large numbers of immature snakes should be attributed to their low detection probabilities, not because they suffer high postnatal mortality. At least three traits contribute to the poor detectability of the immature snakes: (1) their small body size, (2) their lower thermal requirements and (3) their non-permanent emigration to the ‘summer' or foraging habitats, which possess a greater food supply than the ‘winter' habitats where searches for adders are habitually conducted. We tested two hypotheses addressing the proximate causes of time-dependent variation in survival during the adders' first year of life. Results indicated that newborn adders suffered higher mortality during harsh winters, but we found no support for the hypothesis that the feeding status of the newborn snakes affect their survival probabilities.},

abstract = {A method is described for optimizing models by linking simulation procedures with a non-linear regression programme. It is then possible to work towards a parsimonious model which contains those, and only those, variables required for an optimum fit. Using the observed values, and the predicted values from each simulation, the optimizing routine calculates the value of an appropriate loss function. It then makes small changes in the parameters governing the simulation, recalculates the predicted values and the first and second derivative of the loss function with respect to each parameter. The algorithm uses this information to minimize the loss function for a given formulation of the model. The model is improved by adding variables which can be shown statistically to improve the fit, and by removing those which do not. The use of the technique is illustrated with reference to a series of weekly estimates of the total numbers, births and survival probabilities of a population of male and female tsetse flies Glossina morsitans morsitans Westwood. Simulation involved following the lives of cohorts of flies, and of all their progeny, from the time they were deposited as larvae. Development and reproduction were regarded as fixed functions of temperature, but mortality rates of pupae and of adult flies depended on meteorological and biological variables, plus the level of trapping imposed on the population. Potential factors were added singly and the model thereby improved in an objective, stepwise manner. The best fit was achieved when effects on adult survival due to maximum temperature, various modes of trapping, and an annual cycle were included in the model. The optimized simulation technique has been used here in improving a model which describes a biological population but it could equally be used to improve models in any situation where data are fitted using simulation procedures.},

abstract = {A study was undertaken in three districts in south eastern Uganda endemic for human and animal trypanosomiasis, to investigate the status of the vector tsetse fly population. Apparent density (AD) of tsetse was between 2 and 21 flies/trap/day across the three districts, with Glossinia fuscipes fuscipes identified as the predominant species. Trypanosomes were observed in G.f. fuscipes with an infection rate, as determined by microscopy, of 1.55{\%} across the three studied areas. However, trypanosome infections were only identified in female flies giving an infection rate of 2.39{\%} for the female tsetse when this sex was considered in isolation; no male flies were found to be infected. Bloodmeal analysis highlighted 3 principal vertebrate hosts, namely cattle, pigs and monitor lizards (Varanus niloticus). The implication of this, in relation to the cycle of transmission for human infective trypanosomes between domestic animals and man, is discussed. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

They are reported from the tsetse-infested area in the northern part of the country, broadly corresponding to the valley of the Zambezi River. Tsetse-transmitted trypanosomes, in particular T. congolense and T. vivax, also cause morbidity and mortality in livestock, thus generating poverty and food insecurity. Two species of tsetse fly, Glossina morsistans morsitans and G. pallidipes, are known to be present in the Zambezi Valley, although their distributional patterns and densities have not been investigated in detail. The present study tries to address this gap by providing some insight into the dynamics of trypanosomiasis in humans and livestock.},

abstract = {Background: Tsetse (Glossina sensu stricto) are cyclical vectors of human and animal trypanosomoses, that are presently targeted by the Pan African Tsetse and Trypanosomiasis Eradication Campaign (PATTEC) coordinated by the African Union. In order to achieve effective control of tsetse, there is need to produce elaborate plans to guide intervention programmes. A model intended to aid in the planning of intervention programmes and assist a fuller understanding of tsetse distribution was applied, in a pilot study in the Masoka area, Mid-Zambezi valley in Zimbabwe, and targeting two savannah species, Glossina morsitans morsitans and Glossina pallidipes. Methodology/Principal findings: The field study was conducted between March and December 2015 in 105 sites following a standardized grid sampling frame. Presence data were used to study habitat suitability of both species based on climatic and environmental data derived from MODIS and SPOT 5 satellite images. Factors influencing distribution were studied using an Ecological Niche Factor Analysis (ENFA) whilst habitat suitability was predicted using a Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) model at a spatial resolution of 250 m. Area Under the Curve (AUC), an indicator of model performance, was 0.89 for G. m. morsitans and 0.96 for G. pallidipes. We then used the predicted suitable areas to calculate the probability that flies were really absent from the grid cells where they were not captured during the study based on a probability model using a risk threshold of 0.05. Apart from grid cells where G. m. morsitans and G. pallidipes were captured, there was a high probability of presence in an additional 128 km2and 144 km2respectively. Conclusions/Significance: The modelling process promised to be useful in optimizing the outputs of presence/absence surveys, allowing the definition of tsetse infested areas with improved accuracy. The methodology proposed here can be extended to all the tsetse infested parts of Zimbabwe and may also be useful for other PATTEC national initiatives in other African countries. {\textcopyright} 2017 Chikowore et al.},

abstract = {The authors use a quantitative modelling framework to describe and explore the features of the biology of tsetse flies (Glossina spp.) which are important in determining the rate of transmission of the African trypanosomiases between hosts. Examples are presented of the contribution of previous research on tsetse to quantified epidemiological and epizootiological understanding, and areas of current ignorance are identified for future study. Spatial and temporal variations in risk are important (but rarely-studied) determinants of the impact of trypanosomiasis on humans, domestic animals and agricultural activities. Recent grid-based sampling surveys to Togo provide valuable data sets on tsetse, cattle and trypanosomiasis throughout the country. A combination of ground-based meterological and remotely-sensed satellite data, within linear discriminant analytical models, enables description of the observed distributions of the five species of tsetse occurring in Togo, with accuracies of between 72{\%} (Glossina palpalis and G. tachinoides) and 98{\%} (G. fusca). Abundance classes of the two most widespread species, G. palpalis and G. tachinoides, are described with accuracies of between 47{\%} and 83{\%}. This is especially remarkable given the relatively small differences between the average values of the predictor variables in areas of differing fly abundance. Similar analyses could be used to predict the occurrence and abundance of flies in other areas, which have not been surveyed to date, in order to plan tsetse control campaigns or explore development options. Finally, some recent tsetse control campaigns are briefly reviewed. The shift of emphasis from fly eradication to fly control is associated with a devolution of responsibility for control activities from central government to local areas, communities or even individuals. The future role of central governments will remain crucial, however, in determining the areas in which different control options are practised, in facilitating control by local communities and in protecting controlled areas from re-invasion by flies from other areas.},

abstract = {African trypanosomiasis, which affects wildlife, domesticated animals and humans, remains widespread across Africa. Approximately 8 million km2, covering 37 African counties, are infested with tsetse flies (Glossina) that carry the disease (Allsopp 2001). The first part of this paper looks at the history of tsetse control on the northern fly-belt in Zimbabwe, affecting the Mashonaland East, Mashonaland Central and Mashonaland West provinces. In Zimbabwe, tsetse control has shifted and evolved in the twentieth century, ranging from the initial methods of game destruction and bush-clearing, to ground and aerial spraying of insecticides, the sterile insect technique (SIT), tsetse trapping, and the use of insecticides applied to cattle or to artificial baits called targets. The second part of the paper looks at the possible effect of climate change on the abundance and distribution of tsetse by considering how changes in temperature could affect life cycles and breeding patterns. The analysis offers suggestions for the means of alleviating the future effects of any alteration in human-tsetse contact resulting from changes in climate, land use and human populations.

Here we show that ageing is detectable in wild populations of a very short-lived insect, the antler fly (Protopiophila litigata), and causes debilitating and costly effects that force a decline not only in survival probability, but also in the reproductive rate of males. Our findings argue against the possibility of a trade-off between fitness components, whereby survival may decline without senescence if investment in reproduction increases with age, and indicate that ageing rates are subject to intense selection in the wild. },

Not only would the implementation of the proposal be contrary to South African laws protecting and conserving biodiversity, but it would also have negative consequences for the conservation of biodiversity. Some of the negative consequences are reviewed, including extirpations and negative impacts on ecological and ecosystem processes and services. Alternative strategies to control trypanosomiasis in cattle effectively in a more environment-friendly manner are presently available and others will almost certainly become available in the not-too-distant future.Conservation implications: Environmental protection, promotion of conservation and sustainable use of the environment are all deeply seated in South Africa's law. Rural livestock husbandry considerations and biodiversity conservation are not mutually exclusive and the importance of one cannot supersede the other. The eradication proposal is seen to be environmentally damaging and therefore it is concluded that the purpose of this proposed eradication exercise is unconstitutional, contrary to various multilateral agreements South Africa has entered into and contrary to good environmental governance.},

abstract = {A developmental time-table has been established for the embryos of viviparous Diploptera punctata. The percentage of gestation time occupied by pre-dorsal closure stages is only 19 per cent compared to 40 or 50 per cent in non-viviparous species. The increase in wet weight of the embryos begins several days before dorsal closure and continues throughout gestation. The increase in dry weight, protein, carbohydrate, and uric acid does not begin until shortly after dorsal closure but thereafter parallels the increase in wet weight. The increase in o{\"{o}}cyte protein during vitellogenesis is tenfold, less than in oviparous or ovoviviparous species. But the increase in embryo protein during gestation is sixtyfold; this characterizes viviparity in D. punctata. Although total lipid increases during gestation, lipid as a percentage of wet weight decreases most rapidly before dorsal closure and less rapidly there-after. It is suggested that before dorsal closure lipid is the major energy source for development. After dorsal closure the embryos are able to drink through their mouths the fluid nutrient provided by the mother. The ultimate source of nutrients required by developing embryos is the maternal diet during gestation. Females starved from ecdysis do not produce young; females fed only sugar from ecdysis produce viable larvae but suffer loss in body weight. Embryos from such females, although normal in length, are deficient in protein. {\textcopyright} 1973.},

abstract = {Implementation of the sterile insect technique for tsetse (Glossina spp.) requires that only sterile male insects be released; thus, at some stage of the fly production process the females have to be removed. A further constraint in the use of the sterile insect technique for tsetse is that the females are needed for colony production and hence, a non-destructive method of sex separation is required. In most tsetse sterile insect technique programmes thus far, females have been eliminated from the released material by hand-separation of chilled adults. Using near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy, significant differences have been found between the spectra for the pupae of male and female G. pallidipes Austen. Significantly, the differences appear to be maximized 4–5 days before emergence of the adults. Tsetse fly pupae up to five days before emergence can be sexed with accuracies that generally range from 80 to 100{\%}. This system, when refined, will enable effective separation of male and female pupae to be carried out, with emerged females being returned to the colony and males being irradiated and released. If separation can be achieved five days before emergence, this will also enable irra- diated male pupae to be shipped to other destinations as required. Other Diptera were evaluated using this system but had lower classification accuracies of 50– 74{\%}. This may be due to the difference in reproductive physiology between these different fly groups.},

abstract = {The ecology of mosquito vectors and malaria parasites affect the incidence, seasonal transmission and geographical range of malaria. Most malaria models to date assume constant or linear responses of mosquito and parasite life-history traits to temperature, predicting optimal transmission at 31 °C. These models are at odds with field observations of transmission dating back nearly a century. We build a model with more realistic ecological assumptions about the thermal physiology of insects. Our model, which includes empirically derived nonlinear thermal responses, predicts optimal malaria transmission at 25 °C (6 °C lower than previous models). Moreover, the model predicts that transmission decreases dramatically at temperatures {\textgreater} 28 °C, altering predictions about how climate change will affect malaria. A large data set on malaria transmission risk in Africa validates both the 25 °C optimum and the decline above 28 °C. Using these more accurate nonlinear thermal-response models will aid in understanding the effects of current and future temperature regimes on disease transmission.},

Tsetse fl ies are biological peculiarities; not only are they obligate blood feeders, but they reproduce by adenotrophic viviparity [giving birth to live offspring, nourished within the mother by secretion from highly modified accessory glands, and born at an advanced stage of develop­ ment (see 25, 36)]. The female produces a single offspring at regular intervals. It passes three larval instars within the mother and derives all its nourishment from her during this time. After parturition (larviposition) the larva does not feed and usually pupariates within 1-2 hr. Approximately 30 days later, the adult fl y emerges. Thus all the nutrients required for developplent to the adult stage are maternally derived, and accordingly at parturition the larva usually weighs at least as much as the mother (103). In addition, at regular intervals the mother takes blood meals that weigh up to several times the weight of the unfed fl y (103). Thus the female fl y undergoes large changes in volume and weight during each pregnancy cycle; short­ term changes are associated with feeding and long-term changes are associated with the growth of the larva (103). However, these changes impose limitations in terms of feeding and fl ying, which become more severe as pregnancy progresses. The female fly leads a precarious existence and both nutrition and reproduction must be precisely regulated to ensure reproductive success. The interaction between repro­ ductive events and the transfer of nutrients from mother to larva are therefore of importance to our understanding of the physiology of Glossina, and these areas will be of particular concern in the present paper.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Vectorial capacity and the basic reproductive number (R(0)) have been instrumental in structuring thinking about vector-borne pathogen transmission and how best to prevent the diseases they cause. One of the more important simplifying assumptions of these models is age-independent vector mortality. A growing body of evidence indicates that insect vectors exhibit age-dependent mortality, which can have strong and varied affects on pathogen transmission dynamics and strategies for disease prevention.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Based on survival analysis we derived new equations for vectorial capacity and R(0) that are valid for any pattern of age-dependent (or age-independent) vector mortality and explore the behavior of the models across various mortality patterns. The framework we present (1) lays the groundwork for an extension and refinement of the vectorial capacity paradigm by introducing an age-structured extension to the model, (2) encourages further research on the actuarial dynamics of vectors in particular and the relationship of vector mortality to pathogen transmission in general, and (3) provides a detailed quantitative basis for understanding the relative impact of reductions in vector longevity compared to other vector-borne disease prevention strategies.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Accounting for age-dependent vector mortality in estimates of vectorial capacity and R(0) was most important when (1) vector densities are relatively low and the pattern of mortality can determine whether pathogen transmission will persist; i.e., determines whether R(0) is above or below 1, (2) vector population growth rate is relatively low and there are complex interactions between birth and death that differ fundamentally from birth-death relationships with age-independent mortality, and (3) the vector exhibits complex patterns of age-dependent mortality and R(0) ∼ 1. A limiting factor in the construction and evaluation of new age-dependent mortality models is the paucity of data characterizing vector mortality patterns, particularly for free ranging vectors in the field.},

Allele frequencies at five microsatellite loci, and metric properties based on 11 wing landmarks, were compared between four populations. The populations originated from the Mouhoun river and one of its tributaries. The average distance between samples was 72 km with the two most widely spaced populations being 216 km apart. The sampling points traversed an ecological cline in terms of rainfall and riverine forest ecotype, along a river enlarging from downstream to upstream and oriented south to north. Microsatellite DNA comparison demonstrated structuring between the populations, but not complete isolation, with an overall Fst = 0.012 (P {\textless} 0.001). Wing geometry revealed significant centroid size and shape differences between populations, especially between the two most distant populations. There was no significant correlation between gene flow and geographic distance at this scale, but there was a positive correlation in females between metric distances (wing shape differences) and geographic distances that might be attributed to the cline of environmental conditions. The impact of the fragmentation of riparian landscapes on tsetse population structure is discussed in the context of control campaigns currently promoted by Pan African Tsetse and Trypanosomosis Eradication Campaign.},

We compared landmarks, semilandmarks and outlines techniques on male and female samples of species, and suggested adapted strategies according to the countries and their own Glossina fauna. We could compare up to 7 taxa belonging to the three main subgenera of the Glossina genus: Nemorhina (5 species), Glossina (1 species) and Austenina (1 species). Our sample included the major vectors of sleeping sickness: G. palpalis palpalis, G. p. gambiensis, G. fuscipes fuscipes and G. f. quanzensis, as well as two important vectors of African animal trypanosomoses: G. tachinoides and Glossina morsitans submorsitans. The average level of correct species recognition by the wing shape was satisfactory, and slightly higher for females than for males. The best scores of correct assignment, in both sexes, were obtained by the contour technique (96{\%} of correct attribution in females, 92{\%} in males), slightly higher than for semilandmarks (95{\%} and 91{\%}) or landmarks (94{\%} and 89{\%}) techniques. We made our images of wings freely available to be used as reference images (http://mome-clic.com), and we describe the conditions and the analytical steps to be followed to identify unknown specimens using external reference images. Under adequate conditions, such use of reference images obtained from a free access server could help species identification of new samples anywhere in Africa.},

abstract = {Sexual selection should cause sex differences in patterns of resource allocation. When current and future reproductive effort trade off, variation in resource acquisition might further cause sex differences in age-dependent investment, or in sensitivity to changes in resource availability over time. However, the nature and prevalence of sex differences in age-dependent investment remain unclear. We manipulated resource acquisition at juvenile and adult stages in decorated crickets, Gryllodes sigillatus, and assessed effects on sex-specific allocation to age-dependent reproductive effort (calling in males, fecundity in females) and longevity. We predicted that the resource and time demands of egg production would result in relatively consistent female strategies across treatments, whereas male investment should depend sharply on diet. Contrary to expectations, female age-dependent reproductive effort diverged substantially across treatments, with resource-limited females showing much lower and later investment in reproduction; the highest fecundity was associated with intermediate lifespans. In contrast, long-lived males always signalled more than short-lived males, and male age-dependent reproductive effort did not depend on diet. We found consistently positive covariance between male reproductive effort and lifespan, whereas diet altered this covariance in females, revealing sex differences in the benefits of allocation to longevity. Our results support sex-specific selection on allocation patterns, but also suggest a simpler alternative: males may use social feedback to make allocation decisions and preferentially store resources as energetic reserves in its absence. Increased calling effort with age therefore could be caused by gradual resource accumulation, heightened mortality risk over time, and a lack of feedback from available mates.},

abstract = {{\{}ABSTRACT.{\}} A rapid decline in receptivity of mated female Glossina morsitans morsitans Westwood is shown to depend on both physical and chemical stimuli associated with copulation. Radiolabelling revealed the transfer of substances from the male to the haemolymph of the female during copulation. Implantation of male tissues or their injection as homogenates into virgin females showed the chemical stimulus to come from the male accessory glands. Receptivity decreased in females mated to males with ejaculatory ducts severed or testes removed and also in females which had a glass bead inserted into their uterus and/or the tip of their abdomen covered with wax, suggesting that a physical stimulus inducing refractoriness is provided by distension of the uterus and/or stimulation of their terminalial setae. Exposing virgin females to daily short matings in which no male materials were transferred, confirmed this. Receptivity also declined slowly with age in unexposed virgin females. Transfusion of haemolymph from mated females (up to 11 days old) into virgins did not indicate the existence of a haemolymph-borne ovulation-inducing factor; apparently only physical stimuli from mating are involved in the induction of ovulation, and somehow prime the ovarian tissue so that it responds appropriately later when the egg has matured. Whether the stimulus is transmitted to the ovary neurally or hormonally is unknown.},

The four tsetse species and subspecies were also infected simultaneously in vitro on the blood of mice infected with the two clones of T.congolense via a silicone membrane. The infected tsetse were maintained on rabbits and from the day 25 after the infective feed, the surviving tsetse were dissected in order to determine the infection rates. Results showed higher mature infection rates in morsitans-group tsetse flies than in palpalis-group tsetse flies when infected with the savannah type of T.congolense. In contrast, infection rates with the riverine-forest type of T.congolense were lower, and fewer flies showed full development cycle. The intrinsec vectorial capacity of G.m.submorsitans for the two T.congolense types was the highest, whereas the intrinsic vectorial capacity of G.p.gambiensis for the Savannah type and G.m.morsitans for the riverine-forest type were the lowest. Among all tsetse which were infected simultaneously with the two types of T.congolense, the polymerase chain reaction detected only five flies which had both trypanosome taxa in the midgut and the proboscis. All the other infections were attributable to the savannah type. The differences in the gut of different Glossina species and subspecies allowing these two sub-groups of T.congolense to survive better and undergo the complete developmental cycle more readily in some species than other are discussed},

abstract = {While variation in metabolic rate at a single temperature can occur for a variety of reasons and the effect of temperature is well established in insects, within-generation variation of metabolic rate-temperature relationships has been relatively poorly explored. In this study, we investigate the effects of gender, age, feeding and pregnancy, as well as three acclimation temperatures (19, 24, 29°C), on standard metabolic rate and its temperature-dependence within post-developmental (i.e. non-teneral) adult G. morsitans morsitans. Although most of the independent variables influenced metabolic rate at a single test temperature (P{\textless}0.001 in most cases), and cold-acclimation resulted in significant up-regulation of metabolic rate at all test temperatures relative to 24 and 29°C acclimation (P{\textless}0.0001), mass-independent metabolic rate-temperature relationships were surprisingly invariant over all experimental groups (P{\textgreater}0.05 in all cases). Slopes of log10metabolic rate (ml CO2h-1) against temperature (°C) ranged from a minimum of 0.03035 (±S.E.=0.003) in young fasted females to a maximum of 0.03834 (±0.004) in mature fasted males. These findings have implications for predicting the metabolic responses of tsetse flies to short-term temperature variation and may also have applications for modelling tsetse population dynamics as a function of temperature. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {An interactive programme, incorporating a deterministic model of tsetse (Diptera: Glossinidae) populations, was developed to predict the cost and effect of different control techniques applied singly or together. Its value was exemplified by using it to compare: (i) the sterile insect technique (SIT), involving weekly releases optimized at three sterile males for each wild male, and (ii) insecticide-treated cattle (ITC) at 3.5/km(2). The isolated pre-treatment population of adults was 2500 males and 5000 females/km(2); if the population was reduced by 90{\%}, its growth potential was 8.4 times per year. However, the population expired naturally when it was reduced to 0.1 wild males/km(2), due to difficulties in finding mates, so that control measures then stopped. This took 187 days with ITC and 609 days with SIT. If ITC was used for 87 days to suppress the population by 99{\%}, subsequent control by SIT alone took 406 days; the female population increased by 48{\%} following the withdrawal of ITC and remained above the immediate post-suppression level for 155 days; the vectorial capacity initially increased seven times and remained above the immediate post-suppression level for 300 days. Combining SIT and ITC after suppression was a little faster than ITC alone, provided the population had not been suppressed by more than 99.7{\%}. Even when SIT was applied under favourable conditions, the most optimistic cost estimate was 20-40 times greater than for ITC. Modelling non-isolated unsuppressed populations showed that tsetse invaded approximately 8 km into the ITC area compared to approximately 18 km for SIT. There was no material improvement by using a 3-km barrier of ITC to protect the SIT area. In general, tsetse control by increasing deaths is more appropriate than reducing births, and SIT is particularly inappropriate. User-friendly models can assist the understanding and planning of tsetse control. The model, freely available via http://www.tsetse.org, allows further exploration of control strategies with user-specified assumptions.},

abstract = {In the mud-dwelling amphipod, Corophium volutator, the foregut is lined with cuticle and consists of an oesophagus and a stomach, with the latter divided into cardiac, pyloric and funnel regions. The midgut comprises an intestine that is enlarged considerably by three pairs of diverticula: the small anterior dorsal and posterior caeca and the massive ventral caeca. Anteriorly, the intestine encompasses the funnel region and the ventral caeca open into the floor of the stomach at the posterior end of the pyloric region. The hindgut is essentially a simple tube connnecting the intestine with the anus. Particles of food pass along the oesophagus and enter the stomach through a valve. Rows of setae, or folds of cuticle, divide the stomach longitudinally into food, circulation and filtration channels. Ingested particles with a diameter greater than 2 mu m are confined to the food channel and supplied with fluids and enzymes from the circulation channels. The digestive enzymes are produced primarily by the ventral caeca and are supplied to the circulation channels through a valve at the entrance of each ventral caecum. Any fine particles and soluble materials extracted from the food channel in the cardiac region are transported into the filtration channels through the first filter of a two part system. Digestible material continues to be extracted in the pyloric region where the volume of the lumen of the food channel is reduced by the intrusion of the vertex of the ventral pyloric ridge. The basis of this ridge supports the second filter which produces a filtrate with particles less than 0.06 mu m in diameter. Material retained on the filter membrane is returned to the food channel by brush-like setae facing the membrane. The final filtrate is transported to the ventral caeca. A valve at the entrance to each ventral caecum prevents contamination of the filtrate by material in the food channel. All indigestible food is passed sequentially along the funnel, intestine and, finally, the hindgut from which it is voided as a faecal pellet. Most digestion and absorption occur in the ventral caeca where the epithelium is differentiated into the R/F and B cells. The R/F cells have a much thicker and denser microvillous border than the B cells. Each R/F cell also has numerous mitochondria located mainly ventral to the nucleus in the mid-region. Rough and smooth endoplasmic reticula are sited primarily in the apical and basal regions of the cell, respectively. Furthermore, most of the rough endoplasmic reticulum is confined to cells in the distal region of the caecum which probably forms the main site for the production of digestive enzymes. The proximal region of the caecum contains numerous lipid droplets and is probably involved in the absorption, transport and storage of the products of digestion.},

abstract = {African trypanosomiasis, otherwise known as sleeping sickness in humans and nagana in animals, is a parasitic protist passed cyclically by the tsetse fly. Despite more than a century of control and eradication efforts, the fly remains widely distributed across Africa and coextensive with other prevalent diseases. Control and planning are hampered by spatially and temporally variant vector distributions, ecologically irrelevant boundaries, and neglect. Tsetse are particularly well suited to move into previously disease-free areas under climate change scenarios, placing unprepared populations at risk. Here we present the modeling framework ATcast, which combines a dynamically downscaled regional climate model with a temporally and spatially dynamic species distribution model to predict tsetse populations over space and time. These modeled results are integrated with Kenyan population data to predict, for the period 2050 to 2059, exposure potential to tsetse and, by association, sleeping sickness and nagana across Kenya.},

Bibliographic searches were used to build a digital library of MMRR studies and selected data describing the reported outcomes were extracted.{\$}\backslash{\$}n{\$}\backslash{\$}nRESULTS: The resulting database contained 774 unique adult female MMRR experiments involving 58 vector mosquito species from the three main genera of importance to human health: Aedes, Anopheles and Culex. Crude examination of these data revealed patterns associated with geography as well as mosquito genus, consistent with bionomics varying by species-specific life history and ecological context. Recapture success varied considerably and was significantly different amongst genera, with 8, 4 and 1{\{}{\%}{\}} of adult females recaptured for Aedes, Anopheles and Culex species, respectively. A large proportion of experiments (59{\{}{\%}{\}}) investigated dispersal and survival and many allowed disaggregation of the release and recapture data.

This propagation depends on the survival, fertility and dispersal of individuals at each age or stage during their life history, as well as on population growth and (st)age structure. Demography is therefore central to understanding evolution. Recent demographic research provides new perspectives on fitness, the spread of mutations within populations and the establishment of life histories in a phylogenetic context. New challenges resulting from individual heterogeneity, and instances where survival and reproduction are linked across generations are being recognized. Evolutionary demography is a field of exciting developments through both methodological and empirical advances.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: When taking a bloodmeal from humans, tsetse flies can transmit the trypanosomes responsible for sleeping sickness, or human African trypanosomiasis. While it is commonly assumed that humans must enter the normal woodland habitat of the tsetse in order to have much chance of contacting the flies, recent studies suggested that important contact can occur due to tsetse entering buildings. Hence, we need to know more about tsetse in buildings, and to understand why, when and how they enter such places.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Buildings studied were single storied and comprised a large house with a thatched roof and smaller houses with roofs of metal or asbestos. Each building was unoccupied except for the few minutes of its inspection every two hours, so focusing on the responses of tsetse to the house itself, rather than to humans inside. The composition, and physiological condition of catches of tsetse flies, Glossina morsitans morsitans and G. pallidipes, in the houses and the diurnal and seasonal pattern of catches, were intermediate between these aspects of the catches from artificial refuges and a host-like trap. Several times more tsetse were caught in the large house, as against the smaller structures. Doors and windows seemed about equally effective as entry points. Many of the tsetse in houses were old enough to be potential vectors of sleeping sickness, and some of the flies alighted on the humans that inspected the houses.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: Houses are attractive in themselves. Some of the tsetse attracted seem to be in a host-seeking phase of behavior and others appear to be looking for shelter from high temperatures outside. The risk of contracting sleeping sickness in houses varies according to house design.},

abstract = {Activity in virgin and pregnant females of Glossina morsitans morsitans Westw. was very low and mostly took the form of short bursts of flight. Recently-fed virgins and females in early and mid-pregnancy were least active. In late pregnancy, activity increased and more walking occurred. In all classes of females, activity was least around midday, but the V-shaped curve became less pronounced as parturition approached. There was evidence of a slight preference for black over white surfaces when landing but a clear preference for black resting sites. Virgin females preferred to alight and rest on vertical surfaces at the borders of areas of visual contrast; pregnant females preferred to alight and rest on horizontal surfaces and showed no attraction to regions of contrast. In a horizontal light gradient, pregnant females selected lighter resting sites as the day progressed. In late pregnancy, there was an increasing tendency to rest in darker sites. Increasing the temperature in the light gradient caused an increase in activity around 34°C and a switch to photonegative behaviour. After larviposition, the females became strongly photopositive even at high temperature (38°C), but after a feed they reverted to the ‘normal' photonegative response to high temperature.},

In this study, we estimate the dispersal and population size of tsetse populations located along the Mouhoun river in Burkina Faso where tsetse habitats are experiencing increasing fragmentation caused by human encroachment. Dispersal estimated through direct (mark and recapture) and indirect (genetic isolation by distance) methods appeared consistent with one another. In these fragmented landscapes, tsetse flies displayed localized, small subpopulations with relatively short effective dispersal. We discuss how such information is crucial for designing optimal strategies for eliminating this threat. To estimate ecological parameters of wild animal populations, the genetic measures are both a cost- and time-effective alternative to mark-release-recapture. They can be applied to other vector-borne diseases of medical and/or economic importance.},

abstract = {Between the end of Sahel's 1968-73 drought and the early 1980s, the production of the drought-resistant sorghum and millet was increasing at about 1{\%} a year, but simultaneously the population was growing by about 2.5{\%} a year. A 1982 UN study of the developing world's carrying capacity found that given the current low levels of agricultural technology used, about half the Sahelian countries could not be expected to feed themselves. The Sahel's demographic picture is complicated by the way different populations fill the various rainfall zones. The Sahelo-Saharan zone, the land of the nomad herders, can support a human density of only 0.3 people per square kilometer, but the density is actually 2 per square kilometer. The zone to the south, where herders and settled farmers mix, can support 15 people per square kilometer, yet it actually supports 20. the Sudano-Guinean zone at the far south may be able to support a larger population, but it has not been settled in part becuase it has spawned the tsetse fly and black fly. The region's rapidly growing population requires increased food production, yet the Sahelian countries have opted to encourage the cultivation of cash crops, especially cotton and peanuts, at the expense of food crops. Governments now are caught in the trap of depending on commodities, which are delcining in price, to pay rising debts. Extension advice, fertilizer, equipment, and marketing services are in short supply. In response to urban population pressure, Sahelian governments have kept food prices artificially low. With cities growing at an average annual rate of between 4-9{\%}, national leaders fear social disruption and political instability if basic food needs at low prices are not met in the large cities. This policy inadvertently discourages food production. Meanwhile, the food situation for the region as a whole deteriorates to a calamity situation. The pressures of population growth and the emphasis on cash crops have forced families to try to expand grain production by cultivating marginal lands. They also have begun to ignore the fallowing technique, which should be used to allow land time to recover between crops. The need to expand land under cultivation has led to the rapid cutting of trees, trees which once acted to hold soil together and coax rainfall into the ground to raise the water table. Most of the Sahelian nations are now among the worst disaster-afflicted nations in the world. In addition to desertification, the Sahel's climate may be getting drier. Governments may have to take radical steps to change their cropping strategies and to move large numbers of people.},

abstract = {Recent theoretical and empirical studies of the population biology of infectious diseases have helped to improve our understanding of the major factors that influence the three phases of a successful invasion, namely initial establishment, persistence in the longer term and spread to other host communities. Of central importance in all three phases is the magnitude of the basic reproductive rate or transmission potential of the parasite. The value of this parameter is determined by a variety of biological properties of the association between an individual parasite and its host and the interaction between their populations. The recent epidemic of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) in North America and Europe is employed to illustrate the factors that promote disease establishment and spread. The frequency distribution of the number of different sexual partners per unit of time within homosexual communities is shown to be of central importance with respect to future trends in the incidence of AIDS. Broader aspects of pathogen invasion are examined by reference to simple mathematical models of three species associations, which mirror parasite introduction into resident predator-prey, host-parasite and competitive interactions. Many outcomes are possible, depending on the values of the numerous parameters that influence multi-species population interactions. Pathogen invasion is shown to have far-reaching implications for the structure and stability of ecological communities.},

The ecological and evolutionary dynamics of infections play out on a wide range of interconnected temporal, organizational, and spatial scales, which span hours to months, cells to ecosystems, and local to global spread. Moreover, some pathogens are directly transmitted between individuals of a single species, whereas others circulate among multiple hosts, need arthropod vectors, or can survive in environmental reservoirs. Many factors, including increasing antimicrobial resistance, increased human connectivity and changeable human behavior, elevate prevention and control from matters of national policy to international challenge.

abstract = {Foraging cockroaches ingest insecticide baits, translocate them, and can cause mortality in untreated cockroaches that contact the foragers or ingest their excretions. Translocation of eight ingested baits by adult male Blattella germanica (L.) was examined in relation to the type of the active ingredient, formulation, and foraging area. Ingested boric acid, chlorpyrifos, fipronil, and hydramethylnon that were excreted by adults in small dishes killed 100{\%} of first instars within 10 d and {\textgreater}50{\%} of second instars within 14 d. Residues from these ingested baits were also highly effective on nymphs in larger arenas and killed 16-100{\%} of the adults. However, when the baits and dead cockroaches were removed from the large arenas and replaced with new cockroaches, only residues of the slow-acting hydramethylnon killed most of the nymphs and adults, whereas residues of fast acting insecticides (chlorpyrifos and fipronil) killed fewer nymphs and adults. Excretions from cockroaches that ingested abamectin baits failed to cause significant mortality in cockroaches that contacted the residues. These results suggest that hydramethylnon is highly effective in these assays because cockroaches that feed on the bait have ample time to return to their shelter and defecate insecticide-laden feces. The relatively high concentration of hydramethylnon in the bait (2.15{\%}) and its apparent stability in the digestive tract and feces probably contribute to the efficacy of hydramethylnon. To control for differences among baits in inert ingredients and the amount of active ingredient, we compared 1{\%} chlorpyrifos with 1{\%} hydramethylnon in identical baits. Again, hydramethylnon residues provided greater secondary kill, but the results highlighted the importance of the inert ingredients. We conclude that, in the absence of cannibalism and necrophagy, translocation of baits and secondary kill are most effective with slow acting insecticides in palatable baits that can traverse the digestive tract and be deposited within and around the cockroach aggregation.},

abstract = {Color patterns play central roles in the behavior of insects, and are important traits for taxonomic studies. Here we report striking and stable structural color patterns--wing interference patterns (WIPs)--in the transparent wings of small Hymenoptera and Diptera, patterns that have been largely overlooked by biologists. These extremely thin wings reflect vivid color patterns caused by thin film interference. The visibility of these patterns is affected by the way the insects display their wings against various backgrounds with different light properties. The specific color sequence displayed lacks pure red and matches the color vision of most insects, strongly suggesting that the biological significance of WIPs lies in visual signaling. Taxon-specific color patterns are formed by uneven membrane thickness, pigmentation, venation, and hair placement. The optically refracted pattern is also stabilized by microstructures of the wing such as membrane corrugations and spherical cell structures that reinforce the pattern and make it essentially noniridescent over a large range of light incidences. WIPs can be applied to map the micromorphology of wings through direct observation and are useful in several fields of biology. We demonstrate their usefulness as identification patterns to solve cases of cryptic species complexes in tiny parasitic wasps, and indicate their potentials for research on the genetic control of wing development through direct links between the transregulatory wing landscape and interference patterns we observe in Drosophila model species. Some species display sexually dimorphic WIPs, suggesting sexual selection as one of the driving forces for their evolution.},

abstract = {Assessing how environmental changes affect the distribution and dynamics of vegetation and animal populations is becoming increasingly important for terrestrial ecologists to enable better predictions of the effects of global warming, biodiversity reduction or habitat degradation. The ability to predict ecological responses has often been hampered by our rather limited understanding of trophic interactions. Indeed, it has proven difficult to discern direct and indirect effects of environmental change on animal populations owing to limited information about vegetation at large temporal and spatial scales. The rapidly increasing use of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) in ecological studies has recently changed this situation. Here, we review the use of the NDVI in recent ecological studies and outline its possible key role in future research of environmental change in an ecosystem context. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {An analysis of the population changes of Glossina palpalis palpalis (R.-D.) during and after two insecticide trials in Ivory Coast revealed that the effects of insecticide application depend very strongly on the characteristics of the population ecology of the fly, which showed considerable local variation. At sites with high fly populations and low natural mortality rates, the populations declined rapidly during the spray period as the insecticide killed a large proportion of the local, mainly resident, population. The high resilience of the populations, however, permitted rapid recovery, largely through reinvasion from neighbouring areas, so the reduction in fly numbers lasted for only 3-4 months at a time of year when, in the absence of insecticide, the population showed a significant seasonal decline lasting for up to three months. At other sites, with low populations and high natural mortality rates, the local populations were supported chiefly by immigrants and therefore insecticides only affected a very small proportion of the total population and thus did not cause an immediate decline in fly numbers. The low resilience of these populations, however, means that any repeated low additional mortality (such as that caused by removal trapping or deterioration of environmental conditions) would cause the populations to decline. Thus at both types of site, but for rather different reasons, single or short-term insecticide applications had a limited effect on the populations, and longterm, repeated control procedures are considered to be the only ones likely to reduce the populations significantly; through economic necessity these must rely on low-technology devices such as insecticide-impregnated screens or traps. {\textcopyright} 1984, Cambridge University Press.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Ackley, Hargrove. Human and animal trypanosomiasis, spread by tsetse flies (Glossina spp), is a major public health concern in much of sub-Saharan Africa. The basic reproduction number of vector-borne diseases, such as trypanosomiasis, is a function of vector mortality rate. Robust methods for estimating tsetse mortality are thus of interest for understanding population and disease dynamics and for optimal control. Existing methods for estimating mortality in adult tsetse, from ovarian dissection data, often use invalid assumptions of the existence of a stable age distribution, and age-invariant mortality and capture probability. We develop a dynamic model to estimate tsetse mortality from ovarian dissection data in populations where the age distribution is not necessarily stable. The models correspond to several hypotheses about how temperature affects mortality: no temperature dependence (model 1), identical temperature dependence for mature adults and immature stages, i.e., pupae and newly emerged adults (model 2), and differential temperature dependence for mature adults and immature stages (model 3). We fit our models to ovarian dissection data for G. pallidipes collected at Rekomitjie Research Station in the Zambezi Valley in Zimbabwe. We compare model fits to determine the most probable model, given the data, by calculating the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) for each model. The model that allows for a differential dependence of temperature on mortality for immature stages and mature adults (model 3) performs significantly better than models 1 and 2. All models produce mortality estimates, for mature adults, of approximately 3{\%} per day for mean daily temperatures below 25°C, consistent with those of mark-recapture studies performed in other settings. For temperatures greater than 25°C, mortality among immature classes of tsetse increases substantially, whereas mortality remains roughly constant for mature adults. As a sensitivity analysis, model 3 was simultaneously fit to both the ovarian dissection and trap data; while this fit also produces comparable mortality at temperatures below 25°C, it is not possible to obtain good fits to both data sources simultaneously, highlighting the uncertain correspondence between trap catches and population levels and/or the need for further improvements to our model. The modelling approach employed here could be applied to any substantial time series of age distribution data.},

abstract = {Mark-recapture techniques are used for studies of animal populations. With only three sampling occasions, both Bailey's triple-catch (BTC) and Jolly-Seber's (J-S) stochastic method can be applied. As marking and handling of fragile organisms may harm them, and thereby affect their chances of being recaptured, handling should be minimized. This can be achieved by taking a subsample before the main sample at the second sampling occasion. Individuals in the main sample are marked and released, whereas those in the subsample are only used for identifying recaptures. Monte-Carlo simulation was used to compare the subsampling method with the ordinary mark-recapture methods. Model-generated populations were sampled with and without subsampling to provide estimates of population size, loss, and dilution rates. The estimated parameters were compared with their true values to identify biases associated with the sampling methods, using 81 different combinations of population size, dilution rate, loss rate, and sampling effort. Each combination was replicated 1,000 times. In no cases did subsampling perform more poorly than the ordinary methods. J-S was slightly more accurate than BTC to estimate the population size, but only when sampling effort was high. The relative biases associated with estimates of dilution and loss rates were substantial, but declined with increasing population size and sampling effort. Confidence limits for the population parameters generally were reliable and tended to be conservative. We therefore conclude that ordinary mark-recapture methods can be supplemented with subsampling without sacrificing accuracy. Subsampling is especially advantageous in cases where marks are difficult to observe under field conditions.},

In Sub-saharan Africa, both the human and animal variants of the disease are a great obstacle towards agriculture, development, and health. In order to better understand and therefore combat Trypanosomiasis, characterizing disease hotspots across species is critical. Methods: In this study, 193 samples from cattle, sheep, and goats were collected from eight sites. Samples were taken from animals belonging mostly to Maasai herdsmen in the Ngorongoro Crater Conservation Area (NCA) and analysed for the presence of trypanosomiasis infection using PCR techniques. Those that tested positive for T. brucei parasite were further tested using SRA LAMP technique to check for T. brucei rhodesiense, the human infective subspecies of parasite. Results: Our study found a high incidence of Trypanosoma brucei infections across species. Of animals tested, 47 {\%} of cattle, 91.7 {\%} of sheep, and 60.8 {\%} of goats were infected. Most of the infections were of the T. brucei species. We also identified sheep and goats as carriers of the T. brucei rhodesiense subspecies, which causes acute human trypanosomiasis. Conclusions: Together, these results point toward the need for stricter control strategies in the area to prevent disease outbreak.},

abstract = {This article explores four key questions about statistical models developed to describe the recent past and future of vector-borne diseases, with special emphasis on dengue: (1) How many variables should be used to make predictions about the future of vector-borne diseases? (2) Is the spatial resolution of a climate dataset an important determinant of model accuracy? (3) Does inclusion of the future distributions of vectors affect predictions of the futures of the diseases they transmit? (4) Which are the key predictor variables involved in determining the distributions of vector-borne diseases in the present and future? Examples are given of dengue models using one, five or 10 meteorological variables and at spatial resolutions of from one-sixth to two degrees. Model accuracy is improved with a greater number of descriptor variables, but is surprisingly unaffected by the spatial resolution of the data. Dengue models with a reduced set of climate variables derived from the HadCM3 global circulation model predictions for the 1980s are improved when risk maps for dengue's two main vectors (Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus) are also included as predictor variables; disease and vector models are projected into the future using the global circulation model predictions for the 2020s, 2040s and 2080s. The Garthwaite-Koch corr-max transformation is presented as a novel way of showing the relative contribution of each of the input predictor variables to the map predictions.},

Some 45-60{\%} of resighted flies were seen on decoys, the precentage being greater for flies released at an older age. For flies release on emergence, the mean age at first contact with decoys on a static screen was 6.6 days, an average of 4 days later than their first observed contact with a bait ox. There was great variability in the response towards decoys on sucessive contacts. In general, the intensity of the responses to decoys in the first minute after contact (the 'pre-copulatory' responses) decreased from one encounter to the next in a single 1- to 2-h observation session, but were restored to high levels after an interval of several hours. The intensity of responses towards decoys after this initial period (the 'copulatory' responses) were not affected by previous contacts. Neither previous sexual experience nor age at first contact affected the durations of response on decoys. There were no differences between the responses of wild flies and those from a laboratory colony. The results are discussed in relation to the use with chemosterilant for tsetse autosterilization. Over 60{\%} of flies contacting decoys did so more than once, which would increase, cumulatively, the chances of their being sterilized},

abstract = {We present a stage-structured mathematical model of the population dynamics of Triatoma infestans in a single house, as part of a more complex model incorporating domestic Trypanosoma cruzi transmission. Novel features of this model are a formulation in continuous time accounting for demographic stochasticity, temperature-dependent female fecundity and developmental times, and insect stage-dependent host irritability. The model assumes a closed domestic insect population regulated by insect density and stage-dependent host irritability depressing the insects' feeding success and female fecundity. The model describes that the abundance of T. infestans insects fluctuates seasonally with only one peak in summer, whereas eggs show one peak in spring and another in the fall as a result of two peaks in female fecundity. The proportion of recently fed adult insects peaks in summer and falls close to zero in winter only when the intensity of host irritability differs markedly between small and large insect stages. In our model, the insect carrying capacity is the joint result of density-dependent access to hosts and density-independent mortality rates. Our hypothesis is that refuge quality in the house, not the absolute number of refuges, determined by construction features would translate into differential insect stage mortalities. The presence of only one hen brooding indoors during spring and summer increases insect numbers in a clearly detectable way. Sensitivity analysis showed strong effects on timed-averaged insect abundance of prolonged developmental time induced by low temperatures, the threshold insect density for host irritability, and mean female fecundity. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {The sensitivity of males and females of Glossina morsitans morsitans Westwood to the vapour phase of bisazir was tested in the laboratory in a moving air stream at temperatures ranging from 12 to 20°C. Similar tests were conducted in still air in closed systems. Bisazir was used in its granular form or absorbed onto silicone rubber or cellulose fibre surfaces from solution in dichloromethane. As a crystalline solid, it lost only 5{\%} of its weight in a moving air stream over 12 days. However, even in relatively still air, bisazir absorbed onto cellulose fibre discs lost 70{\%} of its weight at 20°C and 80{\%} at 30°C in 24 days. Estimations of the amounts of bisazir present on a surface by weight difference were higher than those estimated by gas chromatographic analysis. Hence, in addition to being volatile, bisazir must be regarded as somewhat unstable. Nevertheless, sufficient active ingredient remained over a long enough period for it to be considered as a practical means of sterilizing tsetse in the field. Females were found more sensitive to bisazir than males, but exposure times required to produce total sterility in both sexes did not affect survival. Exposure times of only a few minutes were sufficient to induce a significant reduction in female fecundity or male fertility at 30–35°C, temperatures which might be expected under field conditions in a device to sterilize automatically tsetse attracted to traps in the field. The degree of sterility induced was permanent, and at these short exposure times the temperature had no effect on female fecundity. {\textcopyright} 1986, Cambridge University Press.

abstract = {A cross-section study was conducted to evaluate knowledge, attitude and practices about tsetse (Glossina) and trypanosomiasis among the agro-pastoralists communities around the Ikorongo/Grumeti game reserves in the Western Serengeti. Structured questionnaire were administered to 80 respondents and out of these 95{\%} had adequate knowledge about tsetse flies and 79{\%} knew the local names of the fly. The study also revealed that 25.5{\%} of respondents recognized the common hideouts of tsetse to be the grazing areas near the reserves 29{\%} along rivers and 20.4{\%} in bushes and forests.  Twenty four percent of respondents knew the clinical signs of African Animal Trypanosomiasis (AAT) which included rough coat, emaciation (21{\%}), diarrhea (13.3{\%}) and loss of appetite (11.9{\%}). Other mentioned disease symptoms which had small proportions included miscarriages, coughing, reduced milk yield and break tail. Ninety six percent of respondents ranked Animal Trypanosomiasis the first among other existing animal diseases in the area including Contagious Bovine Pleuropneumonia (CBPP), Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD), East Coast Fever (ECF) and Anaplasmosis. Chemotherapy was the most practiced method to control trypanosomiasis in the western Serengeti. Cattle owners used isometamedium chloride (samorin) and dimenazine aceturate (berenil) to treat sick animals. Economic losses caused by the disease in their animals were identified to be deaths, reduced milk production and income. Lack of enough resources to contribute to the maintenance of cattle dips and the grazing of animals inside the reserves especially during the dry season when there was shortage of pastures outside the reserves were the main constraints associated with cattle productivity in the area.

Landing was induced in flies that traversed steep odour gradients as they flew upwind and downwind across the edge of an odour plume, irrespective of whether visual targets were present or not; the landing response could be elicited over a wide range of odour concentrations. When targets were present, such odour gradients also tended to increase the proportion of landing flies which alighted on or near the targets; and the bigger the target, or the hungrier the flies, the greater was the propensity for target landing.

The most important vectors of HAT are riverine tsetse and these can be controlled by attracting them to stationary baits such as insecticide-impregnated traps or targets deployed along the banks of rivers. However, the geographical nature of some riverine habitats, particularly mangroves but also extensive lake and river networks, makes deployment of baits difficult and limits their efficacy. It is known that tsetse are attracted by the movement of their hosts.

Concurrently, adults of both species which emerged from locally-collected puparia were marked and released. Recaptures from artificial refuges, odour attractants and mobile baits at periods up to 59 days after release and at distances up to 1800 m from the release site indicated no clear differences between native G. morsitans and the two laboratory-reared groups in respect of body size, amount of fat present at emergence, survival, dispersal, availability to a range of baits, diet, speed of taking a first meal, wing damage and insemination rate. Although the blood-meal identifications for marked female G. morsitans were similar to those for both sexes of unmarked flies, blood-meals from marked males showed a relatively high proportion of bovid identifications. Unmarked flies caught were generally older than marked catches. The ratio of females to males in unmarked samples (1:1 for G. morsitans, 2:1 for G. pallidipes) was roughly double that in marked catches.},

Pathogens are responsible for both numerical changes in host populations and evolutionary changes through selection for resistant genotypes. Linking such ecological and evolutionary dynamics has been the focus of a growing body of literature on the effects of plant diseases in natural ecosystems. A guiding principle is the importance of understanding the spatial and temporal scales at which plants and pathogens interact. This review summarizes the effects of diseases on populations of wild plants, focusing in particular on the mediation of plant competition and succession, the maintenance of plant species diversity, as well as the process of rapid evolutionary changes in host-pathogen symbioses.},

Changes in mean ovarian age and wing-fray category in the tsetse population during the trial were due partially to the pyriproxyfen and partially to high mortality, in the larval/pupal stages and in young adult flies, which occurs each year in the hot/dry season. Chemical analysis of cloth samples indicated that after 4 months 68-85{\%} of the pyriproxyfen had been lost, a large proportion apparently dripping off the bottom of the target.

If animals in a population can be identified from multiple, non-invasive marks then some individuals may be counted twice in the observed data. Analyzing the observed histories without accounting for these errors will provide incorrect inference about the population dynamics. Previous approaches to this problem include modeling data from only one mark and combining estimators obtained from each mark separately assuming that they are independent. Motivated by the analysis of data from the ECOCEAN online whale shark (Rhincodon typus) catalog, we describe a Bayesian method to analyze data from multiple, non-invasive marks that is based on the latent-multinomial model of Link et al. (2010). Further to this, we describe a simplification of the Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm of Link et al. (2010) that leads to more efficient computation. We present results from the analysis of the ECOCEAN whale shark data and from simulation studies comparing our method with the previous approaches.},

Many of the ecological and anthropogenic drivers of disease emergence and classical invasions are also shared, with environmental change and global transport providing opportunities for the introduction and spread of invaders and novel parasites. * The phases of disease emergence and biological invasions have many parallels; particularly the early and late phases, where demographic and anthropogenic factors are key drivers. However, there are also differences in the intermediate phases, where host–parasite co-evolution plays a crucial role in determining parasite establishment in novel hosts. * Similar opportunities and constraints on control and management occur at the different phases of invasions and disease emergence. However, exploitation of host immune responses offers additional control opportunities through contact control and vaccination against EIDs.

abstract = {Classic egg size theory predicts that, in a given environment, there is a level of maternal investment per offspring that will maximize maternal fitness. However, positive correlations among egg size and female body size are observed within populations in diverse animal taxa. A popular explanation for this phenomenon is that, in some populations, morphological constraints on egg size, such as ovipositor size (insects) or pelvic aperture width (lizards and turtles), limit egg size. Egg size may therefore increase with female body size due to body size-specific constraints on investment per offspring, coupled with selection towards an optimal egg size. We use 17 years of data from a population of painted turtles Chrysemys picta to evaluate this hypothesis. In accordance with our predictions, we find that (1) morphological constraints on egg size are apparent only in relatively small females, similarly (2) egg mass exhibits a strong asymptotic relationship with female body size, suggesting egg mass is optimized only at large body sizes, (3) clutch size, not egg mass, varies with female condition, and (4) clutch size varies more than egg mass across years. Contrary to our predictions, we observe that (5) the egg mass-clutch size tradeoff is not less pronounced at large body sizes. Our data do not fully support the traditional hypothesis, and recent models suggest that this hypothesis is indeed overly simplistic. When the selective environment of a female's offspring is influenced by her phenotype, optimal egg size may vary among maternal phenotypes. This concept can explain correlations among egg size and body size in many taxa, as well as the patterns observed in the present study. In this paradigm, a tight coupling of aperture width (or other ‘constraints') and egg size may occur in small females, even when such morphological features are not causally related to variation in egg size. In this spirit, we question validity of invoking morphological constraints to explain covariation among egg size and female body size.},

The government of Senegal has embarked on a project to eliminate this tsetse species, and African animal trypanosomoses, from the Niayes area using an area-wide integrated pest management approach. A stratified entomological sampling strategy was therefore developed using spatial analytical tools and mathematical modeling. A preliminary phytosociological census identified eight types of suitable habitat, which could be discriminated from LandSat 7 ETM+ satellite images and denominated wet areas. At the end of March 2009, 683 unbaited Vavoua traps had been deployed, and the observed infested area in the Niayes was 525 km2. In the remaining area, a mathematical model was used to assess the risk that flies were present despite a sequence of zero catches. The analysis showed that this risk was above 0.05 in 19{\%} of this area that will be considered as infested during the control operations. The remote sensing analysis that identified the wet areas allowed a restriction of the area to be surveyed to 4{\%} of the total surface area (7,150 km2), whereas the mathematical model provided an efficient method to improve the accuracy and the robustness of the sampling protocol. The final size of the control area will be decided based on the entomological collection data. This entomological sampling procedure might be used for other vector or pest control scenarios.},

Details are given of the stages of processing necessary to convert digital data arising from satellite sensors into ecologically meaningful information. Potential sources of error in these processing seeps are also highlighted. Relationships between ground-measured meteorological variables (saturation deficit, ground temperature and rainfall) and data from both the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's, polar-orbiting, meteorological satellites and the geostationary, Meteosat satellite are defined and examples detailed for Africa. Finally, the current status of existing satellite platforms and future satellite missions are reviewed and potential data availability discussed. How such satellite-based predictions have proved valuable in understanding the distribution of tsetse fly species in Cote d'Ivoire and Burkina Faso will be the subject of a future review.},

abstract = {The Luangwa Valley has a long historical association with Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT) and is a recognised geographical focus of this disease. It is also internationally acclaimed for its high biodiversity and contains many valuable habitats. Local inhabitants of the valley have developed sustainable land use systems in co-existence with wildlife over centuries, based on non-livestock keeping practices largely due to the threat from African Animal Trypanosomiasis. Historical epidemics of human sleeping sickness have influenced how and where communities have settled and have had a profound impact on development in the Valley. Historical attempts to control trypanosomiasis have also had a negative impact on conservation of biodiversity.Centralised control over wildlife utilisation has marginalised local communities from managing the wildlife resource. To some extent this has been reversed by the implementation of community based natural resource management programmes in the latter half of the 20(th) century and the Luangwa Valley provides some of the earliest examples of such programmes. More recently, there has been significant uncontrolled migration of people into the mid-Luangwa Valley driven by pressure on resources in the eastern plateau region, encouragement from local chiefs and economic development in the tourist centre of Mfuwe. This has brought changing land-use patterns, most notably agricultural development through livestock keeping and cotton production. These changes threaten to alter the endemically stable patterns of HAT transmission and could have significant impacts on ecosystem health and ecosystem services.In this paper we review the history of HAT in the context of conservation and development and consider the impacts current changes may have on this complex social-ecological system. We conclude that improved understanding is required to identify specific circumstances where win-win trade-offs can be achieved between the conservation of biodiversity and the reduction of disease in the human population.},

abstract = {Dispersion theory is applied to the distribution of two kinds of sterile insect, Mediterranean fruit fly (Medfly), Ceratitis capitata (Wiedemann), and Queensland fruit fly (Qfly), Bactrocera tryoni (Froggatt) (Diptera: Tephritidae). Dispersion theories are an essential basis of sampling theory and sampling plans, but this paper looks at them from another direction and uses data from arrays of sterile insect technique (SIT) monitoring traps to compare the utility of different measures such as coefficient of variation (CV), the exponent b of Taylor's power law, and exponent k of the negative binomial distribution and also derives predictions pertaining to the density (and hence release rate) of sterile insects that would be required to achieve effective coverage of the target area. This is far more useful than reliance on just the mean values of trap catches because such reliance takes no account of the fact that sterile flies distribute themselves unevenly with many patches inadequately covered despite the impression given by the mean. Data were used from recapture rates following either 'roving releases' of Medfly or releases from fixed points of Qfly. The relation of recapture rate to CV indicated that a doubling of release rate in order to double average recapture rate from 150 per trap per week to a value of 300 would have very little effect in terms of reducing CV and that there appears to be no practical prospect of reducing CV to below unity with the current methods of release without incurring a manifold increase in cost. Similarly, models derived from the negative binomial equation indicated that a law of diminishing returns applies in terms of the increase in the amount of adequate coverage (such as the percentage of traps catching {\textgreater} 50 flies per week) that can be obtained by increasing release rates},

Two species were targeted: Glossina tachinoides and Glossina palpalis gambiensis.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The objectives were to test the potentiality of the sequential aerosol technique (SAT) to eliminate riverine tsetse species in a challenging subsection (dense tree canopy and high tsetse densities) of the total sprayed area (6,745 km(2)) and the subsequent efficacy of an integrated strategy including ground spraying (≈100 km(2)), insecticide treated targets (20,000) and insecticide treated cattle (45,000) in sustaining the results of tsetse suppression in the whole intervention area. The aerial application of low-dosage deltamethrin aerosols (0.33-0.35 g a.i/ha) was conducted along the three main rivers using five custom designed fixed-wings Turbo thrush aircraft. The impact of SAT on tsetse densities was monitored using 30 biconical traps deployed from two weeks before until two weeks after the operations. Results of the SAT monitoring indicated an overall reduction rate of 98{\%} (from a pre-intervention mean apparent density per trap per day (ADT) of 16.7 to 0.3 at the end of the fourth and last cycle). One year after the SAT operations, a second survey using 200 biconical traps set in 20 sites during 3 weeks was conducted throughout the intervention area to measure the impact of the integrated control strategy. Both target species were still detected, albeit at very low densities (ADT of 0.27 inside sprayed blocks and 0.10 outside sprayed blocks).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The SAT operations failed to achieve elimination in the monitored section, but the subsequent integrated strategy maintained high levels of suppression throughout the intervention area, which will contribute to improving animal health, increasing animal production and fostering food security.},

abstract = {Anticipatory parental effects (APE's) occur when parents adjust the phenotype of their offspring to match the local environment, so as to increase the fitness of both parents and offspring. APE's, as in the evolution of adaptive phenotypic plasticity more generally, are predicated on the idea that the parental environment is a reliable predictor of the offspring environment. Most studies on APE's fail to explicitly consider environmental predictability so risk searching for APE's under circumstances where they are unlikely to occur. This failure is perhaps one of the major reasons for mixed evidence for APE's in a recent meta-analysis. Here, we highlight some often-overlooked assumptions in studies of APE's and provide a framework for identifying and testing APE's. Our review highlights the importance of measuring environmental predictability, outlines the minimal requirements for experimental designs, explains the important differences between relative and absolute measures of offspring fitness, and highlights some potential issues in assigning components of offspring fitness to parental fitness. Our recommendations should result in more targeted and effective tests of APE's. Synthesis A decent set of theory is available to understand when certain kinds of parental effects might act to increase parental fitness (i.e. be ‘adaptive'). This theory could be better incorporated into empirical studies on anticipatory parental effects (APE's). Here, we provide practical advice for how empirical studies can more closely align with the theoretical underpinnings of adaptive parental effects. In short, robust inferences on APE's require quantitative estimates of environmental predictability in the field over the space and time scales relevant to the life history of the study organism as well as an understanding of when to use absolute or relative offspring fitness.},

Evidence-based, spatially explicit estimates of population at risk are needed to inform planning and implementation of field interventions, monitor disease trends, raise awareness and support advocacy. Comprehensive, geo-referenced epidemiological records from HAT-affected countries were combined with human population layers to map five categories of risk, ranging from "very high" to "very low," and to estimate the corresponding at-risk population.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS:Approximately 70 million people distributed over a surface of 1.55 million km(2) are estimated to be at different levels of risk of contracting HAT. Trypanosoma brucei gambiense accounts for 82.2{\%} of the population at risk, the remaining 17.8{\%} being at risk of infection from T. b. rhodesiense. Twenty-one million people live in areas classified as moderate to very high risk, where more than 1 HAT case per 10,000 inhabitants per annum is reported.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nDISCUSSION:Updated estimates of the population at risk of sleeping sickness were made, based on quantitative information on the reported cases and the geographic distribution of human population. Due to substantial methodological differences, it is not possible to make direct comparisons with previous figures for at-risk population. By contrast, it will be possible to explore trends in the future. The presented maps of different HAT risk levels will help to develop site-specific strategies for control and surveillance, and to monitor progress achieved by ongoing efforts aimed at the elimination of sleeping sickness.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Accurate and reliable laboratory methods are needed for estimation of HIV-1 incidence to identify the high-risk populations and target and monitor prevention efforts. We previously described a single-well limiting-antigen avidity enzyme immunoassay (LAg-Avidity EIA) to detect recent HIV-1 infection.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: We describe here further optimization and characterization of LAg-Avidity EIA, comparing it to the BED assay and a two-well avidity-index (AI) EIA. Specimen sets included longitudinal sera (n = 393), collected from 89 seroconverting individuals from 4 cohorts representing 4 HIV-1 subtypes, and sera from AIDS patients (n = 488) with or without TB co-infections from 3 different cohorts. Ninety seven HIV-1 positive specimens were purchased commercially. The BED assay, LAg-Avidity EIA, AI-EIA and HIV serology were performed, as needed.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Monitoring quality control specimens indicated high reproducibility of the LAg-Avidity EIA with coefficient of variation of {\textless}10{\%} in the dynamic range. The LAg-Avidity EIA has an overall mean duration of recency ($\omega$) of 141 days (95{\%} CI 119-160) at normalized optical density (ODn) cutoff of 1.0, with similar $\omega$ in different HIV-1 subtypes and populations (132 to 143 days). Antibody avidity kinetics were similar among individuals and subtypes by both the LAg-Avidity EIA and AI-EIA compared to the HIV-IgG levels measured by the BED assay. The false recent rate among individuals with AIDS was 0.2{\%} with the LAg-Avidity EIA, compared to 2.9{\%} with the BED assay. Western blot profiles of specimens with increasing avidity confirm accurate detection of recent HIV-1 infections.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate that the LAg-Avidity EIA is a promising assay with consistent $\omega$ in different populations and subtypes. The assay should be very useful for 1) estimating HIV-1 incidence in cross-sectional specimens as part of HIV surveillance, 2) identifying risk factors for recent infections, 3) measuring impact of prevention programs, and 4) studying avidity maturation during vaccine trials.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Caused by trypanosomes and transmitted by tsetse flies, Human African Trypanosomiasis and bovine trypanosomiasis remain endemic across much of rural Uganda where the major reservoir of acute human infection is cattle. Following elimination of trypanosomes by mass trypanocidal treatment, it is crucial that farmers regularly apply pyrethroid-based insecticides to cattle to sustain parasite reductions, which also protect against tick-borne diseases. The private veterinary market is divided between products only effective against ticks (amidines) and those effective against both ticks and tsetse (pyrethroids). This study explored insecticide sales, demand and use in four districts of Uganda where mass cattle treatments have been undertaken by the 'Stamp Out Sleeping Sickness' programme.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: A mixed-methods study was undertaken in Dokolo, Kaberamaido, Serere and Soroti districts of Uganda between September 2011 and February 2012. This included: focus groups in 40 villages, a livestock keeper survey (n = 495), a veterinary drug shop questionnaire (n = 74), participatory methods in six villages and numerous semi-structured interviews.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Although 70.5{\%} of livestock keepers reportedly used insecticide each month during the rainy season, due to a variety of perceptions and practices nearly half used products only effective against ticks and not tsetse. Between 640 and 740 litres of insecticide were being sold monthly, covering an average of 53.7 cattle/km(2). Sales were roughly divided between seven pyrethroid-based products and five products only effective against ticks. In the high-risk HAT district of Kaberamaido, almost double the volume of non-tsetse effective insecticide was being sold. Factors influencing insecticide choice included: disease knowledge, brand recognition, product price, half-life and mode of product action, product availability, and dissemination of information. Stakeholders considered market restriction of non-tsetse effective products the most effective way to increase pyrethroid use.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Conflicts of interest between veterinary business and vector control were found to constrain sleeping sickness control. While a variety of strategies could increase pyrethroid use, regulation of the insecticide market could effectively double the number of treated cattle with little cost to government, donors or farmers. Such regulation is entirely consistent with the role of the state in a privatised veterinary system and should include a mitigation strategy against the potential development of tick resistance.},

abstract = {1. Life-history theory predicts that as the residual reproductive value of an organism declines its current investment in reproduction should increase. This hypothesis has not been previously tested for insects. 2. The results of a laboratory study on the reproductive investment of the willow-carrot aphid, Cavariella aegopodii and the vetch aphid, Megooura viciae were compared with the predictions of the aphid optimal energy partitioning model. 3. The model's assumption that the fecunditiy function in aphids is triangular was supported. 4. As predicted by the model, the sizes of gonads decrease and those of the offspring increase with the age of the mother. 5. The large offspring born towards the end of a mother's life achieve a greater adult weight, mean relative growth rate and potential intrinsic rate of increase than the small offspring born early in a mother's life. The better performance of the last born is a consequence of their large birth size. 6. The size of the offpsring varies inversely and the reproductive investment positively with residual reproductive value. The increase in offspring size towards the end of a mother's life is a consequence of the time lag between ovulation and birth and the cessation of ovulation well before a mother dies. The excess of energy produced by the soma in old mothers is used to accelerate the growth rate of the remaining offspring. This result can be extended to other groups that conform to the aphid model's assumptions.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT.  In constant light or constant darkness, Glossina morsitans morsitans Westwood were found to exhibit no obvious rhythms of parturition, but in LD 12:12 most larvae were deposited during the photophase. When a divided photoperiod chamber was used to expose the female's head to LD 12:12 and the abdomen (containing the larvae in utero) to constant light, parturition coincided with the photophase of the female's head. But, if the abdomen was exposed to LD 12:12 and the female's head received constant light or was painted with black enamel, parturition coincided with the photophase of the larva. When the female's head and abdomen both received LD 12:12 but 11 h out of phase with each other, parturition was equally frequent in each 12h fraction. The results thus suggest that both the mother and larva are capable of entraining the rhythm, and that in a normal pregnancy both participate in establishing the rhythm.

In Folonzo, the survey revealed a diversity of tsetse with 4 species occurring with apparent densities as follows: Glossina tachinoides (8.9 tsetse/trap/day); G. morsitans submorsitans (1.8 tsetse/trap/day); G. palpalis gambiensis (0.6/trap/day) and G. medicorum (0.15 tsetse/trap/day).

The phyto-sociological study allowed discrimination of 6 types of vegetation in both localities, with 3 concordances that are riparian forest, shrubby and woody savannah. In Moussodougou, all tsetse were caught in the riparian forest. That was also the case in Folonzo where a great proportion (95 to 99 {\%} following the season) of G. p. gambiensis and G. tachinoides were caught in the gallery, while G. m. submorsitans was occurring as well in the gallery as in the savannah, and G. medicorum in the forest gallery.

abstract = {Aedes aegypti, the primary vector of dengue virus, is well established throughout urban areas of the Southwestern US, including Tucson, AZ. Local transmission of the dengue virus, however, has not been reported in this area. Although many factors influence the distribution of the dengue virus, we hypothesize that one contributing factor is that the lifespan of female Ae. aegypti mosquitoes in the Southwestern US is too short for the virus to complete development and be transmitted to a new host. To test this we utilized two age grading techniques. First, we determined parity by analyzing ovarian tracheation and found that only 40{\%} of Ae. aegypti females collected in Tucson, AZ were parous. The second technique determined transcript levels of an age-associated gene, Sarcoplasmic calcium-binding protein 1 (SCP-1). SCP-1 expression decreased in a predictable manner as the age of mosquitoes increased regardless of rearing conditions and reproductive status. We developed statistical models based on parity and SCP-1 expression to determine the age of individual, field collected mosquitoes within three age brackets: nonvectors (0-5 days post-emergence), unlikely vectors (6-14 days post-emergence), and potential vectors (15+ days post-emergence). The statistical models allowed us to accurately group individual wild mosquitoes into the three age brackets with high confidence. SCP-1 expression levels of individual, field collected mosquitoes were analyzed in conjunction with parity status. Based on SCP-1 transcript levels and parity data, 9{\%} of collected mosquitoes survived more than 15 days post emergence.},

abstract = {Human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) has been a major public health problem in South Sudan for the last century. Recurrent outbreaks with a repetitive pattern of responding-scaling down activities have been observed. Control measures for outbreak response were reduced when the prevalence decreased and/or socio-political crisis erupted, leading to a new increase in the number of cases. This paper aims to raise international awareness of the threat of another outbreak of sleeping sickness in South Sudan. It is a review of the available data, interventions over time, and current reports on the status of HAT in South Sudan. Since 2006, control interventions and treatments providing services for sleeping sickness have been reduced. Access to HAT diagnosis and treatment has been considerably diminished. The current status of control activities for HAT in South Sudan could lead to a new outbreak of the disease unless 1) the remaining competent personnel are used to train younger staff to resume surveillance and treatment in the centers where HAT activities have stopped, and 2) control of HAT continues to be given priority even when the number of cases has been substantially reduced. Failure to implement an effective and sustainable system for HAT control and surveillance will increase the risk of a new epidemic. That would cause considerable suffering for the affected population and would be an impediment to the socioeconomic development of South Sudan.},

To date, most research considering impacts of climate change on vector-borne diseases assumes that all populations of a given parasite or vector species respond similarly to temperature, regardless of their source population. This may be an inappropriate assumption because spatial variation in selective pressures such as temperature can lead to local adaptation.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Eliminating Rhodesian sleeping sickness, the zoonotic form of Human African Trypanosomiasis, can be achieved only through interventions against the vectors, species of tsetse (Glossina). The use of insecticide-treated cattle is the most cost-effective method of controlling tsetse but its impact might be compromised by the patchy distribution of livestock. A deterministic simulation model was used to analyse the effects of spatial heterogeneities in habitat and baits (insecticide-treated cattle and targets) on the distribution and abundance of tsetse.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The simulated area comprised an operational block extending 32 km from an area of good habitat from which tsetse might invade. Within the operational block, habitat comprised good areas mixed with poor ones where survival probabilities and population densities were lower. In good habitat, the natural daily mortalities of adults averaged 6.14{\%} for males and 3.07{\%} for females; the population grew 8.4× in a year following a 90{\%} reduction in densities of adults and pupae, but expired when the population density of males was reduced to {\textless}0.1/km(2); daily movement of adults averaged 249 m for males and 367 m for females. Baits were placed throughout the operational area, or patchily to simulate uneven distributions of cattle and targets. Gaps of 2-3 km between baits were inconsequential provided the average imposed mortality per km(2) across the entire operational area was maintained. Leaving gaps 5-7 km wide inside an area where baits killed 10{\%} per day delayed effective control by 4-11 years. Corrective measures that put a few baits within the gaps were more effective than deploying extra baits on the edges.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The uneven distribution of cattle within settled areas is unlikely to compromise the impact of insecticide-treated cattle on tsetse. However, where areas of {\textgreater}3 km wide are cattle-free then insecticide-treated targets should be deployed to compensate for the lack of cattle.},

abstract = {The teneral phenomenon, as observed in Glossina sp., refers to the increased susceptibility of the fly to trypanosome infection when the first bloodmeal taken is trypanosome-infected. In recent years, the term teneral has gradually become synonymous with unfed, and thus fails to consider the age of the newly emerged fly at the time the first bloodmeal is taken. Furthermore, conflicting evidence exists of the effect of the age of the teneral fly post eclosion when it is given the infected first bloodmeal in determining the infection prevalence. This study demonstrates that it is not the feeding history of the fly but rather the age (hours after eclosion of the fly from the puparium) of the fly when it takes the first (infective) bloodmeal that determines the level of fly susceptibility to trypanosome infection. We examine this phenomenon in male and female flies from two distinct tsetse clades (Glossina morsitans morsitans and Glossina palpalis palpalis) infected with two salivarian trypanosome species, Trypanosoma (Trypanozoon) brucei brucei and Trypanosoma (Nannomonas) congolense using Fisher's exact test to examine differences in infection rates. Teneral tsetse aged less than 24 hours post-eclosion (h.p.e.) are twice as susceptible to trypanosome infection as flies aged 48 h.p.e. This trend is conserved across sex, vector clade and parasite species. The life cycle stage of the parasite fed to the fly (mammalian versus insect form trypanosomes) does not alter this age-related bias in infection. Reducing the numbers of parasites fed to 48 h.p.e., but not to 24 h.p.e. flies, increases teneral refractoriness. The importance of this phenomenon in disease biology in the field as well as the necessity of employing flies of consistent age in laboratory-based infection studies is discussed},

However, reports to the contrary exist, and human trypano-tolerance has been postulated. Furthermore, there is uncertainty about the actual duration of both stage 1 and stage 2 infection, particularly with respect to how long a patient remains infectious. Understanding such basic parameters of HAT infection is essential for optimising control strategies based on case detection. We considered the potential existence and relevance of human trypano-tolerance, and explored the duration of infectiousness, through a review of published evidence on the natural progression of gambiense HAT in the absence of treatment, and biological considerations. Published reports indicate that most gambiense HAT cases are fatal if untreated. Self-resolving and asymptomatic chronic infections probably constitute a minority if they do indeed exist. Chronic carriage, however, deserves further study, as it could seed renewed epidemics after control programmes cease.},

abstract = {New mosquito control strategies centred on the modifying of populations require knowledge of existing population densities at release sites and an understanding of breeding site ecology. Using a quantitative pupal survey method, we investigated production of the dengue vector Aedes aegypti (L.) (Stegomyia aegypti) (Diptera: Culicidae) in Cairns, Queensland, Australia, and found that garden accoutrements represented the most common container type. Deliberately placed 'sentinel' containers were set at seven houses and sampled for pupae over 10 weeks during the wet season. Pupal production was approximately constant; tyres and buckets represented the most productive container types. Sentinel tyres produced the largest female mosquitoes, but were relatively rare in the field survey. We then used field-collected data to make estimates of per premises population density using three different approaches. Estimates of female Ae. aegypti abundance per premises made using the container-inhabiting mosquito simulation (CIMSiM) model [95{\%} confidence interval (CI) 18.5-29.1 females] concorded reasonably well with estimates obtained using a standing crop calculation based on pupal collections (95{\%} CI 8.8-22.5) and using BG-Sentinel traps and a sampling rate correction factor (95{\%} CI 6.2-35.2). By first describing local Ae. aegypti productivity, we were able to compare three separate population density estimates which provided similar results. We anticipate that this will provide researchers and health officials with several tools with which to make estimates of population densities.},

abstract = {Glossina or tsetse flies, the vectors of sleeping sickness, form a unique group of insects with remarkable characteristics. They are viviparous with a slow rhythm of reproduction (one larva approximately every 10 days) determined by the regular ovulation of alternate ovaries. This unusual physiology enables the age of the females to be estimated by examining the ovaries. The resulting ovarian age structure of tsetse fly populations has been used to develop research into the demography of tsetse flies. Several authors have proposed methods of estimating population growth rates from ovarian age distribution data. However, such methods are applicable only when the growth rate ($\lambda$) is equal to 1 (i.e. the intrinsic rate of increase r is equal to 0). In fact, in this type of estimation, the adult survival rate a (or equivalently the mortality rate) cannot be dissociated from the growth rate. Other independently determined demographic parameters must be used to remove this lack of identifiability. We have built a matrix model of the dynamics of tsetse fly populations which enables the growth rate to be calculated from the pupal survival rate, the pupal period and the adult survival rate. Assuming that the age-groups of the population studied have reached a stable distribution, it is possible to calculate the probabilities for the observed sample of belonging to each of the age-groups, to construct a likelihood function and thus to obtain an estimate of the 'apparent survival rate' $\beta$ = a/$\lambda$. If the pupal survival rate and the pupal period are known, a and $\lambda$ can then be calculated from $\beta$. The application of this method to data collected for over two annual cycles in a savannah habitat (Burkina-Faso) showed a high overall stability in the populations of Glossina palpalis gambiensis. Seasonal fluctuations could be easily interpreted as being the result of climatic changes between the dry and rainy seasons.},

abstract = {Human and animal trypanosomiases are two major constraints to development in Africa. These diseases are mainly transmitted by tsetse flies in particular by Glossina palpalis palpalis in Western and Central Africa. To set up an effective vector control campaign, prior population genetics studies have proved useful. Previous studies on population genetics of G. p. palpalis using microsatellite loci showed high heterozygote deficits, as compared to Hardy-Weinberg expectations, mainly explained by the presence of null alleles and/or the mixing of individuals belonging to several reproductive units (Wahlund effect). In this study we implemented a system of trapping, consisting of a central trap and two to four satellite traps around the central one to evaluate a possible role of the Wahlund effect in tsetse flies from three Cameroon human and animal African trypanosomiases foci (Campo, Bipindi and Fontem). We also estimated effective population sizes and dispersal. No difference was observed between the values of allelic richness, genetic diversity and Wright's F{\textless}inf{\textgreater}IS{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}, in the samples from central and from satellite traps, suggesting an absence of Wahlund effect. Partitioning of the samples with Bayesian methods showed numerous clusters of 2-3 individuals as expected from a population at demographic equilibrium with two expected offspring per reproducing female. As previously shown, null alleles appeared as the most probable factor inducing these heterozygote deficits in these populations. Effective population sizes varied from 80 to 450 individuals while immigration rates were between 0.05 and 0.43, showing substantial genetic exchanges between different villages within a focus. These results suggest that the "suppression" with establishment of physical barriers may be the best strategy for a vector control campaign in this forest context.},

abstract = {Climate warming over the next century is expected to have a large impact on the interactions between pathogens and their animal and human hosts. Vector-borne diseases are particularly sensitive to warming because temperature changes can alter vector development rates, shift their geographical distribution and alter transmission dynamics. For this reason, African trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness), a vector-borne disease of humans and animals, was recently identified as one of the 12 infectious diseases likely to spread owing to climate change. We combine a variety of direct effects of temperature on vector ecology, vector biology and vector-parasite interactions via a disease transmission model and extrapolate the potential compounding effects of projected warming on the epidemiology of African trypanosomiasis. The model predicts that epidemics can occur when mean temperatures are between 20.7°C and 26.1°C. Our model does not predict a large-range expansion, but rather a large shift of up to 60 per cent in the geographical extent of the range. The model also predicts that 46-77 million additional people may be at risk of exposure by 2090. Future research could expand our analysis to include other environmental factors that influence tsetse populations and disease transmission such as humidity, as well as changes to human, livestock and wildlife distributions. The modelling approach presented here provides a framework for using the climate-sensitive aspects of vector and pathogen biology to predict changes in disease prevalence and risk owing to climate change.},

abstract = {Life-history theory concerns the trade-offs that mold the patterns of investment by animals between reproduction, growth, and survival. It is widely recognized that physiology plays a role in the mediation of life-history trade-offs, but the details remain obscure. As life-history theory concerns aspects of investment in the soma that influence survival, understanding the physiological basis of life histories is related, but not identical, to understanding the process of aging. One idea from the field of aging that has gained considerable traction in the area of life histories is that life-history trade-offs may be mediated by free radical production and oxidative stress. We outline here developments in this field and summarize a number of important unresolved issues that may guide future research efforts. The issues are as follows. First, different tissues and macromolecular targets of oxidative stress respond differently during reproduction. The functional significance of these changes, however, remains uncertain. Consequently there is a need for studies that link oxidative stress measurements to functional outcomes, such as survival. Second, measurements of oxidative stress are often highly invasive or terminal. Terminal studies of oxidative stress in wild animals, where detailed life-history information is available, cannot generally be performed without compromising the aims of the studies that generated the life-history data. There is a need therefore for novel non-invasive measurements of multi-tissue oxidative stress. Third, laboratory studies provide unrivaled opportunities for experimental manipulation but may fail to expose the physiology underpinning life-history effects, because of the benign laboratory environment. Fourth, the idea that oxidative stress might underlie life-history trade-offs does not make specific enough predictions that are amenable to testing. Moreover, there is a paucity of good alternative theoretical models on which contrasting predictions might be based. Fifth, there is an enormous diversity of life-history variation to test the idea that oxidative stress may be a key mediator. So far we have only scratched the surface. Broadening the scope may reveal new strategies linked to the processes of oxidative damage and repair. Finally, understanding the trade-offs in life histories and understanding the process of aging are related but not identical questions. Scientists inhabiting these two spheres of activity seldom collide, yet they have much to learn from each other.},

Epidemiological theory predicts that where these two subspecies coexist, the prevalence in non-humans of T. b. rhodesiense will exceed that of T. b. brucei. However, field observations suggest that the opposite is true, with T. b. brucei predominating. Here, we hypothesize that this discrepancy between theory and observations results from a reduction in fitness of T. b. rhodesiense relative to T. b. brucei when outside humans. The hypothesis is sufficient to reconcile theoretical predictions with field observations, and is consistent both with experimental data on parasite maturation probabilities in tsetse and growth rates in non-human serum. Further experiments to elucidate possible fitness costs of human-serum resistance could have significant implications for T. b. rhodesiense control.},

We used data from a longitudinal HIV surveillance in rural South Africa to measure the fraction of people with non-recent HIV infection who are falsely classified as recently HIV-infected by the cBED assay (the long-term false-positive ratio (FPR)) and compared cBED assay-based HIV incidence estimates to longitudinally measured HIV incidence. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We measured the long-term FPR in individuals with two positive HIV tests (in the HIV surveillance, 2003-2006) more than 306 days apart (sample size n = 1,065). We implemented four different formulae to calculate HIV incidence using cBED assay testing (n = 11,755) and obtained confidence intervals (CIs) by directly calculating the central 95(th) percentile of incidence values. We observed 4,869 individuals over 7,685 person-years for longitudinal HIV incidence estimation. The long-term FPR was 0.0169 (95{\%} CI 0.0100-0.0266). Using this FPR, the cross-sectional cBED-based HIV incidence estimates (per 100 people per year) varied between 3.03 (95{\%} CI 2.44-3.63) and 3.19 (95{\%} CI 2.57-3.82), depending on the incidence formula. Using a long-term FPR of 0.0560 based on previous studies, HIV incidence estimates varied between 0.65 (95{\%} CI 0.00-1.32) and 0.71 (95{\%} CI 0.00-1.43). The longitudinally measured HIV incidence was 3.09 per 100 people per year (95{\%} CI 2.69-3.52), after adjustment to the sex-age distribution of the sample used in cBED assay-based estimation. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: In a rural community in South Africa with high HIV prevalence, the long-term FPR of the cBED assay is substantially lower than previous estimates. The cBED assay performs well in HIV incidence estimation if the locally measured long-term FPR is used, but significantly underestimates incidence when a FPR estimate based on previous studies in other settings is used.},

abstract = {1. Theory predicts that mothers should adaptively adjust reproductive investment depending on current reserves and future reproductive opportunities. Females in better intrinsic state, or with more resources, should invest more in current reproduction than those with fewer resources. Across the lifespan, investment may increase as future reproductive opportunities decline, yet may also decline with reductions in intrinsic state. 2. Across many species, larger mothers produce larger offspring, but there is no theoretical consensus on why this is so. This pattern may be driven by variation in maternal state such as nutrition, yet few studies measure both size and nutritional state or attempt to tease apart confounding effects of size and age. 3. Viviparous tsetse flies (Glossina species) offer an excellent system to explore patterns of reproductive investment: females produce large, single offspring sequentially over the course of their relatively long life. Thus, per-brood reproductive effort can be quantified by offspring size. 4. While most tsetse reproduction research has been conducted on laboratory colonies, maternal investment was investigated in this study using a unique field method where mothers were collected as they deposited larvae, allowing simultaneous mother-offspring measurements under natural conditions. 5. It was found that larger mothers and those with a higher fat content produced larger offspring, and there was a trend for older mothers to produce slightly larger offspring. 6. The present results highlight the importance of measuring maternal nutritional state, rather than size alone, when considering maternal investment in offspring. Implications for understanding vector population dynamics are also discussed.},

abstract = {Tsetse flies are the cyclical vectors of trypanosomes, the causative agents of 'sleeping sickness' or human African trypanosomosis (HAT) in humans and 'nagana' or African animal trypanosomosis (AAT) in livestock in Sub-saharan Africa. Many consider HAT as one of the major neglected tropical diseases and AAT as the single greatest health constraint to increased livestock production. This review provides some background information on the taxonomy of tsetse flies, their unique way of reproduction (adenotrophic viviparity) making the adult stage the only one easily accessable for control, and how their ecological affinities, their distribution and population dynamics influence and dictate control efforts. The paper likewise reviews four control tactics (sequential aerosol technique, stationary attractive devices, live bait technique and the sterile insect technique) that are currently accepted as friendly to the environment, and describes their limitations and advantages and how they can best be put to practise in an IPM context. The paper discusses the different strategies for tsetse control i.e. localised versus area-wide and focusses thereafter on the principles of area-wide integrated pest management (AW-IPM) and the phased-conditional approach with the tsetse project in Senegal as a recent example. We argue that sustainable tsetse-free zones can be created on Africa mainland provided certain managerial and technical prerequisites are in place. {\textcopyright} 2012 International Atomic Energy Agency.},

abstract = {How parents divide the energy available for reproduction between size and number of offspring has a profound effect on parental reproductive success. Theory indicates that the relationship between offspring size and offspring fitness is of fundamental importance to the evolution of parental reproductive strategies: this relationship predicts the optimal division of resources between size and number of offspring, it describes the fitness consequences for parents that deviate from optimality, and its shape can predict the most viable type of investment strategy in a given environment (e.g., conservative vs. diversified bet-hedging). Many previous attempts to estimate this relationship and the corresponding value of optimal offspring size have been frustrated by a lack of integration between theory and empiricism. In the present study, we draw from C. Smith and S. Fretwell's classic model to explain how a sound estimate of the offspring size–fitness relationship can be derived with empirical data. We evaluate what measures of fitness can be used to model the offspring size– fitness curve and optimal size, as well as which statistical models should and should not be used to estimate offspring size–fitness relationships. To construct the fitness curve, we recommend that offspring fitness be measured as survival up to the age at which the instantaneous rate of offspring mortality becomes random with respect to initial investment. Parental fitness is then expressed in ecologically meaningful, theoretically defensible, and broadly comparable units: the number of offspring surviving to independence. Although logistic and asymptotic regression have been widely used to estimate offspring size–fitness relationships, the former provides relatively unreliable estimates of optimal size when offspring survival and sample sizes are low, and the latter is unreliable under all conditions. We recommend that the Weibull-1 model be used to estimate this curve because it provides modest improvements in prediction accuracy under experimentally relevant conditions.},

These models must be able to predict the response of populations to anthropogenic change, while handling the major sources of uncertainty. We describe a simple "building block" approach to formulating discrete-time models. We show how to estimate the parameters of such models from time series of data, and how to quantify uncertainty in those estimates and in numbers of individuals of different types in populations, using computer-intensive Bayesian methods. We also discuss advantages and pitfalls of the approach, and give an example using the British grey seal population.},

abstract = {Decision-making and financial planning for tsetse control is complex, with a particularly wide range of choices to be made on location, timing, strategy and methods. This paper presents full cost estimates for eliminating or continuously controlling tsetse in a hypothetical area of 10,000km2 located in south-eastern Uganda. Four tsetse control techniques were analysed: (i) artificial baits (insecticide-treated traps/targets), (ii) insecticide-treated cattle (ITC), (iii) aerial spraying using the sequential aerosol technique (SAT) and (iv) the addition of the sterile insect technique (SIT) to the insecticide-based methods (i-iii).For the creation of fly-free zones and using a 10{\%} discount rate, the field costs per km2 came to US{\$}283 for traps (4 traps per km2), US{\$}30 for ITC (5 treated cattle per km2 using restricted application), US{\$}380 for SAT and US{\$}758 for adding SIT. The inclusion of entomological and other preliminary studies plus administrative overheads adds substantially to the overall cost, so that the total costs become US{\$}482 for traps, US{\$}220 for ITC, US{\$}552 for SAT and US{\$}993 - 1365 if SIT is added following suppression using another method. These basic costs would apply to trouble-free operations dealing with isolated tsetse populations. Estimates were also made for non-isolated populations, allowing for a barrier covering 10{\%} of the intervention area, maintained for 3 years. Where traps were used as a barrier, the total cost of elimination increased by between 29{\%} and 57{\%} and for ITC barriers the increase was between 12{\%} and 30{\%}.In the case of continuous tsetse control operations, costs were estimated over a 20-year period and discounted at 10{\%}. Total costs per km2 came to US{\$}368 for ITC, US{\$}2114 for traps, all deployed continuously, and US{\$}2442 for SAT applied at 3-year intervals. The lower costs compared favourably with the regular treatment of cattle with prophylactic trypanocides (US{\$}3862 per km2 assuming four doses per annum at 45 cattle per km2).Throughout the study, sensitivity analyses were conducted to explore the impact on cost estimates of different densities of ITC and traps, costs of baseline studies and discount rates. The present analysis highlights the cost differentials between the different intervention techniques, whilst attesting to the significant progress made over the years in reducing field costs. Results indicate that continuous control activities can be cost-effective in reducing tsetse populations, especially where the creation of fly-free zones is challenging and reinvasion pressure high. {\textcopyright} 2013 Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.},

Bark was sampled at 0, 3, and 43 days after wounding and analysed using a focused Nd:YAG laser (266 nm). Intensities of (13) C, (25)Mg, (27)Al, (31)P, (32)S, (39)K, (48)Ca, (55)Mn, (57)Fe, (63)Cu and (64)Zn were measured by ICP-MS to study elemental distribution across the bark samples during the wound repair process. A clear accumulation of Mg, P and K at the boundary zone between the lesion and healthy tissue was detected in the wounded samples and was more distinctive at 43 than at 3 days after treatment. This zone of accumulation mapped onto the position of formation of the ligno-suberised boundary zone and differentiation of the wound periderm. These accumulations suggest major roles for Mg, P and K in the non-specific response of Sitka spruce both to wounding, possibly as co-factors to enzymes and energy utilisation. The LA-ICP-MS method developed in this work proved useful to study spatial element distribution across bark samples and has great potential for applications in other areas of plant pathology research.},

abstract = {The occurrence of the blood parasites Haemoproteus and Trypanosoma in the pied flycatcher, Ficedula hypoleuca, was examined to test current hypotheses that parasites reduce the expression of secondary sexual traits, mating success, breeding success, and survival of infected individuals. The results showed that there was no significant relationship between male plumage brightness and Trypanosoma infection, but males infected with Haemoproteus tended to be brighter than uninfected males, partly because first-year males were less often infected than older males. Polygynous males did not have fewer parasites than monogamous males. Females did not choose uninfected males among those they had sampled. Clutch size and laying date were not related to female infection status, and the number and quality of nestlings was not related to parasite infections of either male or female parent. The ability of males to provide parental care was not related to their infection status. The return rate from one breeding season to the next of infected males was not lower than that of uninfected males. The lack of correlations between parasites and male plumage colour and female mate choice apparently do not support the Hamilton-Zuk hypothesis of sexual selection. However, the absence of demonstration of any negative effects of parasites suggests that infection status may not be a direct measure of parasite resistance, or the degree to which the host suffers. Instead, the results support the alternative view that infected individuals have demonstrated their ability to survive and to cope with the parasites, while uninfected individuals are probably not yet tested for their resistance. This points to problems in using parasite prevalences and distributions, at least of some protozoan blood parasites, for tests of Hamilton-Zuk hypothesis, even though this was done in the first test by Hamilton and Zuk and by many later researchers.},

abstract = {The world's climate appears now to be changing at an unprecedented rate. Shifts in the distribution and behaviour of insect and bird species indicate that biological systems are already responding to this change. It is well established that climate is an important determinant of the spatial and temporal distribution of vectors and pathogens. In theory, a change in climate would be expected to cause changes in the geographical range, seasonality (intra-annual variability), and in the incidence rate (with or without changes in geographical or seasonal patterns). The detection and then attribution of such changes to climate change is an emerging task for scientists. We discuss the evidence required to attribute changes in disease and vectors to the early effects of anthropogenic climate change. The literature to date indicates that there is a lack of strong evidence of the impact of climate change on vector-borne diseases (i.e. malaria, dengue, leishmaniasis, tick-borne diseases). New approaches to monitoring, such as frequent and long-term sampling along transects to monitor the full latitudinal and altitudinal range of specific vector species, are necessary in order to provide convincing direct evidence of climate change. effects. There is a need to reassess the appropriate levels of evidence, including dealing with the uncertainties attached to detecting the health impacts of global change.},

abstract = {Background: African trypanosomiasis, also known as "sleeping sickness" in humans and "nagana" in livestock is an important vector-borne disease in Sub-Saharan Africa. Control of trypanosomiasis has focused on eliminating the vector, the tsetse fly (. Glossina, spp.). Effective tsetse fly control planning requires models to predict tsetse population and distribution changes over time and space. Traditional planning models have used statistical tools to predict tsetse distributions and have been hindered by limited field survey data. Methodology/results: We developed an Agent-Based Model (ABM) to provide timing and location information for tsetse fly control without presence/absence training data. The model is driven by daily remotely-sensed environment data. The model provides a flexible tool linking environmental changes with individual biology to analyze tsetse control methods such as aerial insecticide spraying, wild animal control, releasing irradiated sterile tsetse males, and land use and cover modification. Significance: This is a bottom-up process-based model with freely available data as inputs that can be easily transferred to a new area. The tsetse population simulation more closely approximates real conditions than those using traditional statistical models making it a useful tool in tsetse fly control planning.},

abstract = {Four thousand nine hundred and seventy-one trypanosomosis-surveillance records from an open population of Orma Boran cattle raised under natural trypanosomosis challenge in Galana Ranch, Kenya between the years 1990 and 2000 were analysed. The objective of the analysis was to identify epidemiological factors that influenced time-to-treatment of trypanosomosis cases. Under the surveillance programme, blood was being examined fortnightly for trypanosomosis using buffy coat technique. Infected animals were treated when their packed cell volumes (PCV) fell to 25{\%} or lower. The number of days between the first diagnosis and treatment of trypanosomosis cases was obtained from the difference between diagnosis and treatment dates. Days-to-treatment clustered around the screening periods; therefore, time-to-treatment was represented by a series of time points 0-8 at 14-day intervals. Factors postulated to affect the outcome (time-to-treatment) were age of an animal at time of diagnosis, sex, number of trypanosome infections, trypanosome species and season of the year. Five animal generations were generated from birth dates and treated as nuisance parameters. Conditional logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards models were fitted to the data, the former to analyse factors that influenced treatment after time 0 (outcome dichotomised as time 0 or {\textgreater}0) and the latter to analyse factors that influenced time-to-treatment for cases that were treated after time 0, excluding all cases treated on time 0. The majority of the cases (89.5{\%}) were treated on the same day of diagnosis. Trypanosome infections were more likely to be treated after time 0 in dry than in wet season. Similarly, the rate of treatment was lower in the dry than the wet season. An increase in number of previous trypanosome infections reduced the odds of an animal being treated after time 0. Animals that had been exposed to many infections before had higher rates of treatment than those that had minimal experiences. We offer possible reasons for these observations and conclude that selection of animals for breeding purposes in programmes geared towards improving trypanotolerance should take into consideration the environmental factors that affect classification of an animal as being resistant or susceptible. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Epidemiological theory predicts that where these two subspecies coexist, the prevalence in non-humans of T. b. rhodesiense will exceed that of T. b. brucei. However, field observations suggest that the opposite is true, with T. b. brucei predominating. Here, we hypothesize that this discrepancy between theory and observations results from a reduction in fitness of T. b. rhodesiense relative to T. b. brucei when outside humans. The hypothesis is sufficient to reconcile theoretical predictions with field observations, and is consistent both with experimental data on parasite maturation probabilities in tsetse and growth rates in non-human serum. Further experiments to elucidate possible fitness costs of human-serum resistance could have significant implications for T. b. rhodesiense control.},

The Gambian form is currently a major public health problem over vast areas of central and western Africa, while the zoonotic, Rhodesian form continues to present a serious health risk in eastern and southern Africa. The two parasites cause distinct clinical manifestations, and there are significant differences in the epidemiology of the diseases caused. We discuss the differences between the diseases caused by the two parasites, with an emphasis on disease burden, reservoir hosts, transmission, diagnosis, treatment and control. We analyse how these differences impacted on historical disease control trends and how they can inform contemporary treatment and control options. We consider the optimal ways in which to devise HAT control policies in light of the differing biology and epidemiology of the parasites, and emphasise, in particular, the wider aspects of control policy, outlining the responsibilities of individuals, governments and international organisations in control programmes. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

There were significant differences in measurements of retinal vascular caliber, tortuosity, and fractal dimension among the three ethnic groups. In multiple linear regression model controlling for age, sex, body mass index, systolic blood pressure, cholesterol, and glucose levels, Indians had the largest arteriolar and venular calibers (arterioles [SE]: 158.94 mu m [1.00]; venules: 228.26 mu m [1.53]), followed by Malays (arterioles: 138.31 mu m [0.74]; venules: 204.26 mu m [1.13]), and then Chinese (arterioles: 131.20 mu m [0.84]; venules: 195.09 mu m [1.28]). Chinese had the largest arteriolar and venular tortuosity (arterioles [x 10(5)]: 7.20 [0.08]; venules [x 10(5)]: 9.09 [0.10]), and venular fractal dimension (1.244 [0.003]). There were no statistically significant differences in other retinal vascular parameters after correcting multiple comparisons by the method of modified false discovery rate.CONCLUSIONS. We found that among ethnic groups composed of healthy Chinese, Malay, and Indians, there were statistically significant differences in several retinal parameters. There exist racial influences in retinal vascular parameters and other yet unknown or unmeasured environmental factor or lifestyle habits and genetic variations not related to race that may also contribute to these differences.},

The government of Senegal has embarked on a project to eliminate this tsetse species, and African animal trypanosomoses, from the Niayes area using an area-wide integrated pest management approach. A stratified entomological sampling strategy was therefore developed using spatial analytical tools and mathematical modeling. A preliminary phytosociological census identified eight types of suitable habitat, which could be discriminated from LandSat 7 ETM+ satellite images and denominated wet areas. At the end of March 2009, 683 unbaited Vavoua traps had been deployed, and the observed infested area in the Niayes was 525 km2. In the remaining area, a mathematical model was used to assess the risk that flies were present despite a sequence of zero catches. The analysis showed that this risk was above 0.05 in 19{\%} of this area that will be considered as infested during the control operations. The remote sensing analysis that identified the wet areas allowed a restriction of the area to be surveyed to 4{\%} of the total surface area (7,150 km2), whereas the mathematical model provided an efficient method to improve the accuracy and the robustness of the sampling protocol. The final size of the control area will be decided based on the entomological collection data. This entomological sampling procedure might be used for other vector or pest control scenarios.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: To evaluate the relative effectiveness of tsetse control methods, their costs need to be analysed alongside their impact on tsetse populations. Very little has been published on the costs of methods specifically targeting human African trypanosomiasis.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In northern Uganda, a 250 km2 field trial was undertaken using small (0.5 X 0.25 m) insecticide-treated targets ("tiny targets"). Detailed cost recording accompanied every phase of the work. Costs were calculated for this operation as if managed by the Ugandan vector control services: removing purely research components of the work and applying local salaries. This calculation assumed that all resources are fully used, with no spare capacity. The full cost of the operation was assessed at USD 85.4 per km2, of which USD 55.7 or 65.2{\%} were field costs, made up of three component activities (target deployment: 34.5{\%}, trap monitoring: 10.6{\%} and target maintenance: 20.1{\%}). The remaining USD 29.7 or 34.8{\%} of the costs were for preliminary studies and administration (tsetse surveys: 6.0{\%}, sensitisation of local populations: 18.6{\%} and office support: 10.2{\%}). Targets accounted for only 12.9{\%} of the total cost, other important cost components were labour (24.1{\%}) and transport (34.6{\%}).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nDISCUSSION: Comparison with the updated cost of historical HAT vector control projects and recent estimates indicates that this work represents a major reduction in cost levels. This is attributed not just to the low unit cost of tiny targets but also to the organisation of delivery, using local labour with bicycles or motorcycles. Sensitivity analyses were undertaken, investigating key prices and assumptions. It is believed that these costs are generalizable to other HAT foci, although in more remote areas, with denser vegetation and fewer people, costs would increase, as would be the case for other tsetse control techniques.},

abstract = {There has been considerable debate as to whether global risk from vector-borne diseases will be impacted by climate change. This has focussed on important mosquito-borne diseases that are transmitted by the vectors from infected to uninfected humans. However, this debate has mostly ignored the biological diversity of vectors and vector-borne diseases. Here, we review how climate and climate change may impact those most divergent of arthropod disease vector groups: multivoltine insects and hard-bodied (ixodid) ticks. We contrast features of the life cycles and behaviour of these arthropods, and how weather, climate, and climate change may have very different impacts on the spatiotemporal occurrence and abundance of vectors, and the pathogens they transmit.},

The t(1/2) for disaggregation was found to be directly dependent upon temperature and inversely proportional to the antibody concentration. The trypanosomes were always motile and metabolically active during aggregation and after disaggregation and were fully infective for a mammalian host following disaggregation as well as able to grow and divide normally during axenic culture. The disaggregation was strictly energy dependent and was inhibited when intracellular ATP levels were reduced by salicylhydroxamic acid or following addition of oligomycin while respiring glucose. In addition the process of disaggregation was dependent upon normal endosomal activity as evidenced by its sensitivity to a wide variety of inhibitors of various endosomal functions. Disaggregation was not due to separation of immunoglobulin chains by either disulphide reduction or disulphide exchange reactions and gross proteolytic cleavage of the immunoglobulins attached to the surface of the parasite was not detected. In addition, gross cleavage or release of the VSG from the surface of the cell did not occur during disaggregation but proteolytic cleavage of a small proportion of either the VSG or the immunoglobulins could not be eliminated from consideration. Finally the mechanism of disaggregation was found to be a regulated process, independent of Ca2+movements but dependent upon the activity of protein kinase C or related kinases and inhibited by the activity of protein kinase A as evidenced by the effects of a panel of inhibitors and cAMP analogues on the process of disaggregation. The mechanism of disaggregation displayed by trypanosomes aggregated by anti-VSG antibody is proposed to form part of the parasite's defence against the host immune system and functions to aid survival of trypanosomes in the presence of antibody in the host prior to the occurrence of a VSG switching event.

abstract = {OBJECTIVE This study aimed to identify isolated population(s) of Glossina palpalis in Ghana using geometric morphometrics to evaluate variations in wing-shape and size between populations of the fly from three regions. RESULTS Wing shape of G. palpalis tsetse flies from the Northern, Western and Eastern Regions varied significantly between each other. Populations from the Northern and Western Regions varied the most (Mahalanobis Distance = 54.20). The least variation was noticed between populations from the Western and Eastern Regions (MD = 1.99). On morphospace, the Northern population clearly separated from the Eastern and Western populations both of which overlapped. Wing centroid size also significantly varied among populations. Reclassification scores were satisfactory reaching 100{\%} for the Northern population. The Northern population of G. palpalis is possibly isolated from the Western and Eastern Region populations. Meanwhile, a panmictic relationship could be on-going between the Western and Eastern populations. We speculate that geographical distance and subspecific difference between populations are among factors responsible for observed pattern of wing shape variations among the studied populations. The implications of results regarding choice of control strategy and limitations of the study are discussed.},

@article{Filin2015,
abstract = {Variation in offspring size with female size and other aspects of the maternal phenotype is commonly observed and taxonomically widespread. However, life history theory predicts that optimal offspring size should not depend on maternal size or total reproductive effort. This incongruity persists despite various modifications to theory, that nonetheless, either are limited in their applicability or fail to alter the prediction of fixed offspring size. I demonstrate that the persistence of this theoretical outcome stems from an ideal assumption that reproductive effort relates only to direct material costs, and therefore, equal or proportional to clutch mass or the product of offspring size and number. A major innovation in my study is to explicitly distinguish between direct and overhead components of the costs of reproduction. When overhead energetic costs of reproduction are explicitly incorporated, I readily obtain variation in optimal offspring size with maternal phenotype. This consequence of overhead costs of reproduction has not been demonstrated before. I identify functional forms of such overhead costs that facilitate variation in optimal offspring size. In particular, costs that are more sensitive to offspring size than to offspring number are most effective in causing variation in offspring size. The novelty of the model lies in succeeding to resolve the above incongruity both within the framework of traditional models of optimal offspring size and within more dynamic description of the lifecycle (addressing simultaneously both offspring and maternal performance), including stochastic effects, difference between reserves and structural components of size, and distinction between starvation and extrinsic mortality. My predictions explain several patterns of variation in size and body composition of offspring, with respect to both environmental conditions and maternal phenotype.},

By 2008, the target coverage was 80{\%} of households and the Global Fund had financed a phased scale-up of LLIN distribution in the region.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nLOCAL SETTING: South Sudan's entire population is considered to be at risk of malaria. Poor control of the vectors and the large-scale movements of returnees, internally displaced people and refugees have exacerbated the problem.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRELEVANT CHANGES: By 2012, approximately 8.0 million LLINs had been distributed in South Sudan.

Mosquito-borne diseases (malaria, filariasis, dengue, zika, and chikungunya) cause severe mortality and morbidity annually, and tsetse fly-borne diseases (African trypanosomes causing sleeping sickness in humans and nagana in livestock) cost Sub-Saharan Africa an estimated US{\$} 4750 million annually. Current reliance on insecticides for vector control is unsustainable: due to increasing insecticide resistance and growing concerns about health and environmental impacts of chemical control there is a growing need for novel, effective and safe biologically-based methods that are more sustainable. The integration of the sterile insect technique has proven successful to manage crop pests and disease vectors, particularly tsetse flies, and is likely to prove effective against mosquito vectors, particularly once sex-separation methods are improved. Transgenic and symbiont-based approaches are in development, and more advanced in (particularly Aedes) mosquitoes than in tsetse flies; however, issues around stability, sustainability and biosecurity have to be addressed, especially when considering population replacement approaches. Regulatory issues and those relating to intellectual property and economic cost of application must also be overcome. Standardised methods to assess insect quality are required to compare and predict efficacy of the different approaches. Different combinations of these three approaches could be integrated to maximise their benefits, and all have the potential to be used in tsetse and mosquito area-wide integrated pest management programmes.},

The traps consisted of coloured trays filled with water plus small quantities of formalin and detergent. Colour was thought to be the major factor attracting flies to the traps, white traps being most effective for G. m. submorsitans and black ones for G. tachinoides. Water traps were compared with biconical traps, and both methods showed similar changes in catches in different vegetation types over a year. Males and females of both species showed a marked expansion in distribution in the rains and a contraction to riverine woodland in the dry season, though females of G. m. submorsitans could be caught in the adverse deciduous woodland and open savanna all year round. Water traps are considered a very cheap and practicable sampling method for ecological studies on these species of Glossina, providing specimens well preserved upon capture for later morphometric and analytical studies. {\textcopyright} 1982, Cambridge University Press.

abstract = {BACKGROUND Tsetse flies (genus Glossina) are large blood-sucking dipteran flies that are important as vectors of human and animal trypanosomiasis in sub-Saharan Africa. Tsetse anatomy has been well described, including detailed accounts of the functional anatomy of the proboscis for piercing host skin and sucking up blood. The proboscis also serves as the developmental site for the infective metacyclic stages of several species of pathogenic livestock trypanosomes that are inoculated into the host with fly saliva. To understand the physical environment in which these trypanosomes develop, we have re-examined the microarchitecture of the tsetse proboscis. RESULTS We examined proboscises from male and female flies of Glossina pallidipes using light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Each proboscis was removed from the fly head and either examined intact or dissected into the three constituent components: Labrum, labium and hypopharynx. Our light and SEM images reaffirm earlier observations that the tsetse proboscis is a formidably armed weapon, well-adapted for piercing skin, and provide comparative data for G. pallidipes. In addition, the images reveal that the hypopharynx, the narrow tube that delivers saliva to the wound site, ends in a remarkably ornate and complex structure with around ten finger-like projections, each adorned with sucker-like protrusions, contradicting previous descriptions that show a simple, bevelled end like a hypodermic needle. The function of the finger-like projections is speculative; they appear to be flexible and may serve to protect the hypopharynx from influx of blood or microorganisms, or control the flow of saliva. Proboscises were examined after colonisation by Trypanosoma congolense savannah. Consistent with the idea that colonisation commences in the region nearest the foregut, the highest densities of trypanosomes were found in the region of the labrum proximal to the bulb, although high densities were also found in other regions of the labrum. Trypanosomes were visible through the thin wall of the hypopharynx by both light microscopy and SEM. CONCLUSIONS We highlight the remarkable architecture of the tsetse proboscis, in particular the intricate structure of the distal end of the hypopharynx. Further work is needed to elucidate the function of this intriguing structure.},

abstract = {This paper investigates a RVF epidemic model by qualitative analysis and numerical simulations. Qualitative analysis have been used to explore the stability dynamics of the equilibrium points while visualization techniques such as bifurcation diagrams, Poincare ´ maps, maxima return maps and largest Lyapunov exponents are numerically computed to confirm further complexity of these dynamics induced by the seasonal forcing on the mosquitoes oviposition rates. The obtained results show that ordinary differential equation models with external forcing can have rich dynamic behaviour, ranging from bifurcation to strange attractors which may explain the observed fluctuations found in RVF empiric outbreak data, as well as the non deterministic nature of RVF inter-epidemic activities. Furthermore, the coexistence of the endemic equilibrium is subjected to existence of certain number of infected Aedes mosquitoes, suggesting that Aedes have potential to initiate RVF epidemics through transovarial transmission and to sustain low levels of the disease during post epidemic periods. Therefore we argue that locations that may serve as RVF virus reservoirs should be eliminated or kept under control to prevent multi-periodic outbreaks and consequent chains of infections. The epidemiological significance of this study is: (1) low levels of birth rate (in both Aedes and Culex) can trigger unpredictable outbreaks; (2) Aedes mosquitoes are more likely capable of inducing unpredictable behaviour compared to the Culex; (3) higher oviposition rates on mosquitoes do not in general imply manifestation of irregular behaviour on the dynamics of the disease. Finally, our model with external seasonal forcing on vector oviposition rates is able to mimic the linear increase in livestock seroprevalence during inter-epidemic period showing a constant exposure and presence of active transmission foci. This suggests that RVF outbreaks partly build upon RVF inter-epidemic activities. Therefore, active RVF surveillance in livestock is recommended. Cit},

abstract = {Loiasis is a filarial disease caused Loa loa. The main vectors are Chrysops silacea and C. dimidiata which are confined to the tropical rainforests of Central and West Africa. Loiasis is a mild disease, but individuals with high microfilaria loads may suffer from severe adverse events if treated with ivermectin during mass drug administration campaigns for the elimination of lymphatic filariasis and onchocerciasis. This poses significant challenges for elimination programmes and alternative interventions are required in L. loa co-endemic areas. The control of Chrysops has not been considered as a viable cost-effective intervention; we reviewed the current knowledge of Chrysops vectors to assess the potential for control as well as identified areas for future research. We identified 89 primary published documents on the two main L. loa vectors C. silacea and C dimidiata. These were collated into a database summarising the publication, field and laboratory procedures, species distributions, ecology, habitats and methods of vector control. The majority of articles were from the 1950–1960s. Field studies conducted in Cameroon, Democratic Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Nigeria and Sudan highlighted that C. silacea is the most important and widespread vector. This species breeds in muddy streams or swampy areas of forests or plantations, descends from forest canopies to feed on humans during the day, is more readily adapted to human dwellings and attracted to wood fires. Main vector targeted measures proposed to impact on L. loa transmission included personal repellents, household screening, indoor residual spraying, community-based environmental management, adulticiding and larviciding. This is the first comprehensive review of the major L. loa vectors for several decades. It highlights key vector transmission characteristics that may be targeted for vector control providing insights into the potential for integrated vector management, with multiple diseases being targeted simultaneously, with shared human and financial resources and multiple impact. Integrated vector management programmes for filarial infections, especially in low transmission areas of onchocerciasis, require innovative approaches and alternative strategies if the elimination targets established by the World Health Organization are to be achieved.},

abstract = {The methods of Bailey and of Jolly and Seber were used to provide maximum likelihood estimates of population parameters for Jackson's classical mark-recapture experiments on males of the tsetse fly Glossina m. morsitans Westwood. These were compared with Jolly-Seber (J-S) estimates for the same fly from more recent work on Antelope Island, Lake Kariba, Zimbabwe. The Bailey estimates of birth and death rates and total population size had markedly lower variances than Jackson's originals. Both sets of estimates provided moving averages over 6-week periods, whereas the Jolly-Seber analysis provided independent weekly estimates and their variance is consequently higher. Saturation deficit and maximum temperature (Tmax) accounted for 11 and 16{\%} respectively of the variance in independent 4-week means of the weekly J-S survival probabilities. Analysis of covariance, carried out on a joint data set of smoothed J-S estimates of the survival probability in Tanzania and Zimbabwe, showed a significant effect of Tmaxon survival. When this effect was removed, the survival probability in the Tanzania studies was found to be 8{\%} lower than on Antelope Island. The two effects accounted for 50{\%} of the variance in the joint data. When saturation deficit was substituted for Tmax, regression only accounted for 35{\%} of the variance. If saturation deficit is important in determining tsetse survival, it must act on stages other than the post-teneral adult. Given the continuous increase in mortality, even at moderate temperatures, it is hard to envisage a direct effect of Tmax. There may be an indirect effect, however, via the number of hunger-related deaths resulting from the increase in the feeding rate with increasing temperature.},

Instantaneous rates of insemination increase exponentially with age in both species; 90{\%} insemination levels are reached after 5 days post-emergence in G. m. morsitans and 7 days in G. pallidipes, varying little with season. More than 95{\%} of both species have ovulated by the age of 8 days and 99{\%} by 12 days. Older flies that have not ovulated are {\textgreater} 100-fold more likely to be caught in October and November than in other months. A 500-fold decrease in trap catches did not result in any detectible decrease in the probability of females being inseminated. The proportion of partially filled spermathecae rises for approximately 6 days then declines, consistent with some flies having mated more than once. For flies caught on electric nets, with wings undamaged during capture, wing-fray data are used to extend ovarian age estimates up to 11 ovulations. Among these flies, the volume of sperm in the spermathecae declines little in flies that have ovulated up to seven times; thereafter, it declines by approximately 1{\%} per ovulation. The time course of insemination and the mating frequency of females are important considerations in modelling tsetse fly populations, as well as for the dynamics of interventions involving the release of genetically-modified insects, which should not be seriously compromised by the limited levels of polyandry currently observed},

abstract = {Tsetse flies are the most important vectors of African trypanosomiasis but, surprisingly, are highly refractory to trypanosome parasite infection. In populations of wild caught flies, it is rare to find mature salivarian and mouthpart parasite infection rates exceeding 1 and 15{\%}, respectively. This inherent refractoriness persists throughout the lifespan of the fly, although extreme starvation and suboptimal environmental conditions can cause a reversion to the susceptible phenotype. The teneral phenomenon is a phenotype unique to newly emerged, previously unfed tsetse, and is evidenced by a profound susceptibility to trypanosome infection. This susceptibility persists for only a few days post-emergence and decreases with fly age and bloodmeal acquisition. Researchers investigating trypanosome-tsetse interactions routinely exploit this phenomenon by using young, unfed (teneral) flies to naturally boost trypanosome establishment and maturation rates. A suite of factors may contribute, at least in part, to this unusual parasite permissive phenotype. These include the physical maturity of midgut barriers, the activation of immunoresponsive tissues and their effector molecules, and the role of the microflora within the midgut of the newly emerged fly. However, at present, the molecular mechanisms that underpin the teneral phenomenon still remain unknown. This review will provide a historical overview of the teneral phenomenon and will examine immune-related factors that influence, and may help us better understand, this unusual phenotype.},

This optimization is done based on relative costs of sterile males and of flying time. An example is presented using data on the Mediterranean fruit fly, Ceratitis capitata (Weidmann), from the Moscamed program in Guatemala. For the parameter values used, the cost (sterile males plus flights) is minimized when insects are released at intervals of approximately every 2 days (for daily mortality $\mu$ = 0.24) to 10 days (for $\mu$ = 0.04) and flights are spaced at 300 m (for $\mu$ = 0.24) to 600 m (for $\mu$ = 0.04) apart, depending on daily medfly mortality estimates, which vary widely in the literature.

abstract = {Female Glossina pallidipes Austen trapped with baited NG2B traps were subjected both to detailed ovarian dissection and to nutritional analysis. Using a calibration curve derived from dissected wild-caught, laboratory-held flies, the field females were assigned by discriminant analysis to each day of the pregnancy cycle. Field females were most available to NG2B traps while carrying the first instar larva. The nutritional characteristics of trapped field females over the pregnancy cycle lead to the following main conclusions. (i) Fat levels increase most rapidly during the egg in utero stage, while CRDW increases significantly only during the larval stages, culminating in a 4 mg increase during the last day of the third larval instar. (ii) The haematin content of the flies indicates that females feed at approximately 3-day intervals and may feed on any day of the pregnancy cycle. (iii) The estimated time of feeding during the day corresponds with the observed time of peak activity, both of which are earlier in the day later in the pregnancy cycle. (iv) The rate of fat usage reveals significantly greater flight activity on day 5 of the cycle than on other days, agreeing with the high trappability on this day, and overall females appear to use fat at twice the rate of males. Reproductive data provide a much more accurate picture of the relative sampling efficiency than do nutritional data, although the latter reveal the general trends correctly.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 Hargrove, Muzari. The biology of adult tsetse (Glossina spp), vectors of trypanosomiasis in Africa, has been extensively studied – but little is known about larviposition in the field. In September-November 1998, in the hot-dry season in Zimbabwe's Zambezi Valley, we used artificial warthog burrows to capture adult females as they deposited larvae. Females were subjected to ovarian dissection and were defined as perinatal flies, assumed to have entered burrows to larviposit, if oocyte sizes indicated {\textgreater}95{\%} pregnancy completion. Perinatal flies were defined as full-term pregnant if there was a late third instar larva in utero, or postpartum if the uterus was empty. All other females were defined as pre-full-term pregnant (pre-FT). Of 845 G. m. morsitans captured, 91{\%} (765) were female and 295/724 (41{\%}) of females dissected were perinatal flies. By contrast, of 2805 G. pallidipes captured only 71{\%} (2003) were female and only 33{\%} (596/1825) of females were perinatal. Among all perinatal females 67{\%} (596/891) were G. pallidipes. Conversely, in burrows not fitted with traps – such that flies were free to come and go – 1834 (59{\%}) of pupae deposited were G. m. morsitans and only 1297 (41{\%}) were G. pallidipes. Thus, while more full-term pregnant G. pallidipes enter burrows, greater proportions of G. m. morsitans larviposit in them, reflecting a greater discrimination among G. pallidipes in choosing larviposition sites. Catches of males and pre-FT females increased strongly with temperatures above 32°C, indicating that these flies used burrows as refuges from high ambient temperatures. Conversely, catches of perinatal females changed little with maximum temperature but declined from late September through November: females may anticipate that burrows will be inundated during the forthcoming wet season. Ovarian age distributions of perinatal and pre-FT females were similar, consistent with all ages of females larvipositing in burrows with similar probability. Artificial warthog burrows provide a novel method for collecting tsetse pupae, studying tsetse behaviour at larviposition, assessing the physiological status of female tsetse and their larvae, and of improving understanding of the physiological dynamics of terminal pregnancy, and population dynamics generally, with a view to improving methods of trypanosomiasis control.},

abstract = {Introduction Advancement in the design of such important gas-phase processes as hydrocarbon cracking, combustion, and partial oxidation hinges, in part, on the development of correct, detailed chemical kinetic models. But the complexity of the required chemical mechanisms can make them extremely difficult to construct by hand. Modelers turn to software algorithms that build these large mechanisms automatically (e.g. [1], [2]), but the current tools are too limited to treat many difficult systems. We present a new, elementary-step-based mechanism generation algorithm, called " XMG-PDep, " which overcomes these limitations with a comprehensive approach to pressure-dependent reactions, and a rational, flux-based criteria for truncating mechanism growth. Applications to the previously intractable methane and high-conversion ethane pyrolysis systems yield predictions which agree well with experimental data, without any parameter adjustment. Important new pathways, not previously considered, but discovered entirely by the new approach, can explain unusual behavior in these systems, and suggest the power of this software tool. Computational Method: The XMG-PDep Algorithm XMG-PDep is based upon XMG [3], which developed from NetGen [4]. It employs flux-based termination of the otherwise combinatorial in species and reactions. To do this, the code periodically constructs and integrates the set of differential equations that represent the evolution of the reacting system in time (assuming a well-mixed batch reactor model). It evaluates a characteristic mechanism flux Rchar(t), which is similar to a root-mean-square average of chemical fluxes in the mechanism [5]. XMG-PDep then compares this flux with those to candidate species that have been discovered, but not yet included, in the mechanism. Those species whose fluxes exceed the cutoff flux (equal to a user-specified fraction of Rchar(t)) are included in the mechanism; the rest are not. XMG-PDep can systematically discover and include arbitrary pressure-dependent reactions, using the algorithm of ref [6]. To allow the most flexibility, XMG-PDep considers any elementary step of the form A + B → C, B → C or B → C + D to initiate a partial pressure-dependent network. For each partial network, XMG-PDep uses the QRRK/MSC code CHEMDIS [7] to estimate the k(T,P) values of every net pressure-dependent reaction. It also examines the maximum flux to all non-included portions of the partial pressure-dependent network. If this flux is greater than the cutoff flux, the partial network is " grown " by one isomer, with all its high-pressure-limit elementary steps, and the k(T,P) calculation is repeated. Growth of each partial pressure-dependent network is halted when the flux to non-included portions is less than the cutoff flux. In this way pressure-dependent reactions can be included systematically and rationally. A full description of the integrated algorithm for generating mechanisms is presented in ref. [8]. Finally, XMG-PDep includes a number of other features designed to make it accurate and useful. It employs literature-based libraries of rate constants and thermochemical parameters whenever possible. Its rate rules are subdivided as much as is reasonable to provide the best estimates for high-pressure-limit rates when these are not available from the library. Thermochemical data (when not available from the data library) are taken from a group contribution method [9] and used to ensure thermodynamic reversibility. The code will produce a CHEMKIN mechanism, and a number of analyses of the mechanism (such as the net radical rate of production for each reaction), when finished with generation.},

abstract = {Successful mechanical transmission of surra between animals by tabanid flies (Diptera: Tabanidae) depends to a large extent on the blood-feeding behaviour of the tabanid species prevalent in the area. We studied tabanid-host interactions in Australia to better predict risk of surra transmission and design intervention strategies. At least six tabanid species were observed alighting on horses, pigs and kangaroos, but the most abundant were Tabanus pallipennis Macquart, Pseudotabanus silvester Bergroth and T. townsvilli Ricardo. The behaviour of tabanids in terms of landing location on the host body, duration of feeding and the proportion completing the blood-meal varied with fly species and host species. The findings predict that some species of tabanid such as T. pallipennis should be better vectors and some species of host such as pigs should be better reservoirs of surra based on the inability of flies to feed to repletion and longer feeding durations. This will result in multiple feeds and increased risk of exposure to the infectious agent, respectively, which increases the risk of transmission. Insecticide treatments should target preferred feeding sites on the host's body. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

(2) The method of analysis is tested on the output of a simple population model for tsetse and predicts qualitative changesin mortality under all conditions and quantitative changes when the mortality acts equally on all life stages. (3) Fly round recordsf or female G. morsitan submorsitans from the Yankari Game Reserve, N. Nigeria, for the period 1964-73, are analysed using the new method. Mean monthly density independent mortalities are calculated and are shown to be most closely related to mean monthly saturation deficit. (4)Values of density independent mortality are superimposed on an annual climogram for Bauchi, near the study site, and mortality contours are drawn enclosing regions of equal mortality. This procedure identifies an environmental optimum for the subspecies between 24 and 26C and 5-13mm Hg saturation deficit. (5) Less complete data from Zambia are also analysed and identify a similar optimum for G.m.morsitans at between 22 and 23C and 7-11mm Hg saturation deficit. These two optima are compared with previous estimates derived by quite different methods.

These correlations are not found in the tropics outside of Africa, where the fly does not exist.

We further describe how such mechanisms might have generated pleiotropic effects responsible for tumor mitigation and pathogen control in bat hosts. These synergisms may enable 'special' tolerance of intracellular pathogens in bat hosts; paradoxically, this may leave them more susceptible to immunopathological morbidity when attempting to clear extracellular infections such as 'white-nose syndrome' (WNS).},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: To evaluate the relative effectiveness of tsetse control methods, their costs need to be analysed alongside their impact on tsetse populations. Very little has been published on the costs of methods specifically targeting human African trypanosomiasis.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In northern Uganda, a 250 km2 field trial was undertaken using small (0.5 X 0.25 m) insecticide-treated targets ("tiny targets"). Detailed cost recording accompanied every phase of the work. Costs were calculated for this operation as if managed by the Ugandan vector control services: removing purely research components of the work and applying local salaries. This calculation assumed that all resources are fully used, with no spare capacity. The full cost of the operation was assessed at USD 85.4 per km2, of which USD 55.7 or 65.2{\%} were field costs, made up of three component activities (target deployment: 34.5{\%}, trap monitoring: 10.6{\%} and target maintenance: 20.1{\%}). The remaining USD 29.7 or 34.8{\%} of the costs were for preliminary studies and administration (tsetse surveys: 6.0{\%}, sensitisation of local populations: 18.6{\%} and office support: 10.2{\%}). Targets accounted for only 12.9{\%} of the total cost, other important cost components were labour (24.1{\%}) and transport (34.6{\%}).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nDISCUSSION: Comparison with the updated cost of historical HAT vector control projects and recent estimates indicates that this work represents a major reduction in cost levels. This is attributed not just to the low unit cost of tiny targets but also to the organisation of delivery, using local labour with bicycles or motorcycles. Sensitivity analyses were undertaken, investigating key prices and assumptions. It is believed that these costs are generalizable to other HAT foci, although in more remote areas, with denser vegetation and fewer people, costs would increase, as would be the case for other tsetse control techniques.},

abstract = {One of the most studied phenomena in ecology is density dependent regulation. The model most frequently used to study this behaviour is the theta-logistic model. However, disagreement has developed within the ecology community pertaining to the interpretation of this model's parameters, and thus as to appropriate values for the parameters to assume. In particular, the parameter $\theta$ has been allowed to take negative values, resulting in the 'growth rate parameter' estimated to be negative for species which are extant and exhibit no signs of becoming extinct in the short-term. Here we explain this phenomenon by formulating the theta-logistic model in the manner in which the original logistic model was formulated by Verhulst (1838), in doing so providing a simple interpretation of model parameters and thus restrictions on values the parameters may assume. We conclude that $\theta$ should (almost always) be restricted to values greater than - 1. This has implications for studies assessing the form of density dependence from data. Additionally, another model appearing in the literature is presented which provides a more flexible model of density dependence at the expense of only one additional parameter. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Trypanosoma spp, biologically transmitted by the tsetse fly in Africa, are a major cause of illness resulting in both high morbidity and mortality among humans, cattle, wild ungulates, and other species. However, tsetse fly distributions change rapidly due to environmental changes, and fine-scale distribution maps are few. Due to data scarcity, most presence/absence estimates in Kenya prior to 2000 are a combination of local reports, entomological knowledge, and topographic information. The availability of tsetse fly abundance data are limited, or at least have not been collected into aggregate, publicly available national datasets. Despite this limitation, other avenues exist for estimating tsetse distributions including remotely sensed data, climate information, and statistical tools.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here we present a logistic regression model of tsetse abundance. The goal of this model is to estimate the distribution of tsetse fly in Kenya in the year 2000, and to provide a method by which to anticipate their future distribution. Multiple predictor variables were tested for significance and for predictive power; ultimately, a parsimonious subset of variables was identified and used to construct the regression model with the 1973 tsetse map. These data were validated against year 2000 Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) estimates. Mapcurves Goodness-Of-Fit scores were used to evaluate the modeled fly distribution against FAO estimates and against 1973 presence/absence data, each driven by appropriate climate data.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Logistic regression can be effectively used to produce a model that projects fly abundance under elevated greenhouse gas scenarios. This model identifies potential areas for tsetse abandonment and expansion.},

abstract = {Control of tsetse flies using insecticide-treated targets is often hampered by vegetation re-growth and encroachment which obscures a target and renders it less effective. Potentially this is of particular concern for the newly developed small targets (0.25 high × 0.5 m wide) which show promise for cost-efficient control of Palpalis group tsetse flies. Consequently the performance of a small target was investigated for Glossina fuscipes fuscipes in Kenya, when the target was obscured following the placement of vegetation to simulate various degrees of natural bush encroachment. Catches decreased significantly only when the target was obscured by more than 80{\%}. Even if a small target is underneath a very low overhanging bush (0.5 m above ground), the numbers of G. f. fuscipes decreased by only about 30{\%} compared to a target in the open. We show that the efficiency of the small targets, even in small (1 m diameter) clearings, is largely uncompromised by vegetation re-growth because G. f. fuscipes readily enter between and under vegetation. The essential characteristic is that there should be some openings between vegetation. This implies that for this important vector of HAT, and possibly other Palpalis group flies, a smaller initial clearance zone around targets can be made and longer interval between site maintenance visits is possible both of which will result in cost savings for large scale operations. We also investigated and discuss other site features e.g. large solid objects and position in relation to the water's edge in terms of the efficacy of the small targets.},

abstract = {Most ectothermic organisms mature at smaller body sizes when reared in warmer conditions. This phenotypically plastic response, known as the "temperature-size rule" (TSR), is one of the most taxonomically widespread patterns in biology. However, the TSR remains a longstanding life-history puzzle for which no dominant driver has been found. We propose that oxygen supply plays a central role in explaining the magnitude of ectothermic temperature-size responses. Given the much lower oxygen availability and greater effort required to increase uptake in water vs. air, we predict that the TSR in aquatic organisms, especially larger species with lower surface area-body mass ratios, will be stronger than in terrestrial organisms. We performed a meta-analysis of 1,890 body mass responses to temperature in controlled experiments on 169 terrestrial, freshwater, and marine species. This reveals that the strength of the temperature-size response is greater in aquatic than terrestrial species. In animal species of ∼100 mg dry mass, the temperature-size response of aquatic organisms is 10 times greater than in terrestrial organisms (-5.0{\%} °C(-1) vs. -0.5{\%} °C(-1)). Moreover, although the size response of small ({\textless}0.1 mg dry mass) aquatic and terrestrial species is similar, increases in species size cause the response to become increasingly negative in aquatic species, as predicted, but on average less negative in terrestrial species. These results support oxygen as a major driver of temperature-size responses in aquatic organisms. Further, the environment-dependent differences parallel latitudinal body size clines, and will influence predicted impacts of climate warming on food production, community structure, and food-web dynamics.},

The model consisted of a biological part (insect dispersal) and an economic part. The biological part used random walks and diffusion equations to describe insect dispersal and to determine the minimum width of the buffer zone required to protect the core area from immigration of pests from outside. In the economic part, the size of the core area was calculated to determine the point at which the revenues from the core area equal the control costs. This model will need to be calibrated and validated for each species and geographic location. Tsetse flies and the Mediterranean fruit fly are used as case studies to illustrate the model.},

abstract = {1. The temperature excess developed by insects under known radiation strength equivalent to sunshine has been studied in relation to modifying factors in a wind tunnel in the laboratory.2. Temperature excess was measured by a thermocouple unit in the larger insects, and by the increase in rate of wing beat in Drosophila.3. Temperature excess varied directly with radiation strength.4. For insects of breadth greater than 0.3 cm. spectral composition of radiation over the normal sunshine range was of negligible importance to the temperature excess.5. The effect of colour on the temperature excess was slight. Absorptivity was estimated by comparing temperatures of normal and black-painted insects. Some insects were hotter in the normal state because of change in the site of absorption of heat. White-painted insects were 64-85 {\%} as hot as when black painted, because the white paint still absorbs infra-red radiation.6. Temperature excess varied with a power of the size between 0.7 and 0.4 in the plasticine spheres, according to size. Temperature excess of the locust type varied as about the 0.4 power of the size; of the Diptera-Hymenoptera type, as about the 1.0 power. Size for size, compared with the spheres, the locust became between half as hot again and twice as hot, and the Diptera-Hymenoptera type between half as hot again and three times as hot, as the plasticine spheres.7. Temperature excess varied inversely as the square root of the wind speed above speeds of 20-30 cm./sec. and tended to become independent at lower speeds, with the transition between forced and natural convection. The latter condition will be more important close to the ground.8. Temperature rise by flight activity is not additive to temperature rise from radiation because it is associated with extra cooling.9. Evolution of insects from the type of the Orthoptera to the Diptera and Hymenoptera has been associated with the attainment of greater temperature excess for given body size. This is probably of selective significance.},

The vegetation type along river banks is an important factor determining the distribution and abundance of these tsetse. The following work investigated the relation between the plant species present (including the disturbance level) and tsetse distribution and abundance, using three ecotypes, described by P.C. Morel in 1978. These were the Guinean, Sudano-Guinean and Sudanese gallery forests. In the Mouhoun River basin, these three ecotypes are found successively from upstream to downstream. Berlinia grandiflora, Syzygium guineense and Cola laurifolia and finally Acacia seyal and Mitragyna inermis were the best indicators for the Guinean, Sudano-Guinean and Sudanese gallery forest ecotypes, respectively, as suggested by Morel. However, other species such as Pterocarpus santalinoides and Mimosa pigra were not ecotype specific. Trap catches confirmed that G. palpalis and G. tachinoides are predominant in Guinean and Sudanese gallery forests, respectively, and that both species are well represented in the Sudano-Guinean ecotype. Tsetse densities dropped significantly in disturbed Sudano-Guinean and Sudanese gallery forest sites. However, this was not the case for both species in Guinean or for G. tachinoides in half-disturbed Sudanese gallery forest sites, confirming their high resilience to human-made changes. The importance of a detailed consideration of riverine ecotypes when predicting tsetse densities is discussed.},

abstract = {Female tsetse flies, Glossina pallidipes Austen, caught in artificial refuges were subjected to ovarian dissection and analysed for levels of fat, residual dry weight (RDW) and haematin. There were rather small proportions of flies in ovarian categories 0 and 1, in part due to large losses in the immature and teneral stages at the hottest time of year. The distribution of the female catch among pregnancy days was close to uniform. The wet and dry weights (WW and DW) and RDW of eggs, larvae and pupae increased by 0.821, 0.303 and 0.204 mg respectively, with each mm3 increase in volume. Water accounted for 71.7{\%} of the fat-free WW, and fat for 32.7{\%} of the DW. Between birth and ovulation, fat increased from 2 to 4 mg and RDW from 7 to 11 mg; thoracic RDW increased by 2.5mg and changed little thereafter. Fat levels increased 3.5mg by day 6 of pregnancy, but only 0.5 mg thereafter. Over the same periods RDW corrected to zero haematin (CRDW) increased by 1 and 8 mg respectively. Full-term fat and CRDW levels were 8.2 and 19.4 mg respectively. Cumulative haematin frequencies formed a smooth curve with a slope that increased continuously. The raw data were well fitted by a model where feeding rates increased exponentially and capture probability was independent of haematin content. The mean feeding interval was 60 h; feeding probabilities of {\textgreater}0.9/day were only found in flies that had failed to feed for{\textgreater}72 h. In early pregnancy, fat levels declined with haematin for flies that had fed{\textgreater}36 h previously; by days 5-7 fat levels were maintained at a constant high level for 60 h post-feeding. Fat-haematin graphs for female tsetse cannot be used to estimate rates of fat utilization. Traps sample tsetse with below-average fat and RDW in early and late pregnancy respectively. Refuge samples are less biased than those from traps; they give a better picture of the dynamics of pregnancy in normal flies and facilitate the explanation of existing anomalies.},

We reconstruct the phylogenetic relationships within Hippoboscoidea using maximum parsimony and Bayesian methods based on nucleotide sequences from fragments of four genes: nuclear 28S ribosomal DNA and the CPSase domain of CAD, and mitochondrial 16S rDNA and cytochrome oxidase I. We recover monophyly for most of the presently recognized groups within Hippoboscoidea including the superfamily as a whole, the Hippoboscidae, the Nycteribiidae, the bat flies, and the Pupipara (=Hippoboscidae+Nycteribiidae+Streblidae), as well as several subfamilies within the constituent families. Streblidae appear to be paraphyletic. Our phylogenetic hypothesis is well supported and decisive in that most competing topological hypotheses for the Hippoboscoidea require significantly longer trees. We confirm a single shift from a free-living fly to a blood-feeding ectoparasite of vertebrates and demonstrate that at least two host shifts from mammals to birds have occurred. Wings have been repeatedly lost, but never regained. The hippoboscoid ancestor also evolved adenotrophic viviparity and our cladogram is consistent with a gradual reduction in the motility of the deposited final instar larvae from active burrowing in the soil to true pupiparity where adult females glue the puparium within the confines of bat roosts. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc.

The northern half of the Delta (7180 km2) was sprayed in June-September 2001 and the southern half (8720 km2) in May-August 2002. A barrier (mean width ≈ 10 km) of 12,000 deltamethrin-treated targets was deployed at the interface of these two blocks to prevent tsetse from invading from the southern to the northern block. Prior to spraying, the mean catches of tsetse from man fly-rounds were 44.6 round/day in the northern block and 101 in the southern. Between September 2002 and November 2005, surveys (∼820 daily fly-rounds and ∼2050 trap-days) in the northern and southern blocks failed to detect tsetse. Simulations of tsetse populations suggest that while spraying operations can reduce tsetse populations to levels that are difficult to detect by standard survey techniques, such populations will recover to densities {\textgreater}100 tsetse/km2 after 1000 days, at which density there is a very high probability ({\textgreater}0.999) that the survey methods will catch at least one fly. Since none was caught, it is argued that tsetse have been eliminated from the Delta. The particular success of this operation in comparison to the 18 aerial spraying operations conducted in the Delta prior to 2001 is attributed to the application of an adequate dose of insecticide, the use of a GPS-based navigation system to ensure even application of insecticide, and the large size and spatial arrangement of the spray blocks coupled with the use of a barrier of targets which prevented tsetse from re-invading the northern sprayed block before the southern one was treated. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The body temperature of these mice has been shown to increase 3-4 C to levels typical of a febrile response. In the present study, the synthesis of parasite heat shock proteins (hsp60, hsp70, and hsp90) was shown to be enhanced at a temperature of 39 C and the results of immunoprecipitation analysis indicated that parasite HSPs are highly immunogenic in T. cruzi-infected mice maintained at 36 C or room temperature (RT). Differences in the histopathology of cardiac and skeletal muscle in C3HeB/FeJ mice maintained at RT or 36 C at different times postinfection also were investigated in this study. The lower numbers of circulating parasites observed in mice maintained at 36 C were correlated with lower levels of tissue parasitism, inflammation, and tissue destruction. Finally, the transfer of infected mice from RT to an environment of 36 C at various times during infection was shown to increase the survival rate of infected mice and also resulted in a dramatic reduction in parasitemia levels. In light of the growing evidence for a beneficial effect of elevated temperature during experimental Chagas' disease, further studies seem warranted to determine if hyperthermia or fever therapy might also be beneficial in the treatment of humans infected with T. cruzi.},

Since 1990, sporadic blood sampling of cattle at the dip tanks in the naganainfested areas were undertaken to identify trypanosome species involved and to determine the infection prevalence in cattle. The distribution and species composition of the tsetse populations in the area were also investigated. From November 2005 to November 2007 selected dip tanks were surveyed for trypanosome infection prevalence. During April 2005 to August 2009 the distribution and abundance of tsetse populations were assessed with odour-baited H traps. The tsetse and trypanosome distribution maps were updated and potential correlations between tsetse apparent densities (ADs) and the prevalence of trypanosomosis were assessed. Glossina brevipalpis Newstead and Glossina austeni Newstead were recorded in locations where they have not previously been collected. No significant correlation between tsetse relative abundance and nagana prevalence was found, which indicated complex interactions between tsetse fly presence and disease prevalence. This was epitomised by data that indicated that despite large differences in the ADs of G. austeni and G. brevipalpis, trypanosome infection prevalence was similar in all three districts in the area. This study clearly indicated that both tsetse species play significant roles in trypanosome transmission and that it will be essential that any control strategy, which aims at sustainable management of the disease, should target both species.Keywords: Tsetse distribution; Glossina brevipalpis; Glossina austeni; trypanosome infection prevalence},

abstract = {An incomplete ring of electrified nets was placed round a trap or round an electrified net and visual target in woodland infested with Glossina morsitans morsitans Westw. and G. pallidipes Aust. in Rhodesia. The distribution of catches in these systems was used to estimate the minimum efficiencies with which the trap or net and target captured flies that were initially attracted by odours derived from a herd of cattle hidden below ground. With mature tsetse, the estimates for the trap were 23 and 21{\%} for male and female G. morsitans, respectively, and 70 and 49{\%} for male and female G. pallidipes. For the net and target, the corresponding figures were 29, 30, 53 and 43. The coefficient of variation of such estimates (about 10{\%}) was low enough to suggest that the technique affords a quick and reliable means of screening the efficiency of many trap designs. Factors responsible for the efficiency of the trap were elucidated. Data for other insects were obtained. {\textcopyright} 1979, Cambridge University Press. All rights reserved.},

Restoration of the inseminating ability took 2 h rest. Experienced and virgin males were equally successful at mating. Insemination occurred during the last 30 s of the mating period and 1 male inseminated 9 females on the average. Females mated in a 1:1 or a 1:3 male/female ratio were equally productive. The females that were mated in a 1:3 ratio survived better. Series of 3 successive matings, alternating with periods of rest, showed that males did not regain their original inseminating capacity. In the 1st series, all 3 mates were inseminated, but in subsequent series only the 1st and the 2nd.

abstract = {Free-living haematophagous insects risk death through host grooming responses or through increased susceptibility to predation whenever they take a bloodmeal. In this paper we investigate the effects of these risks on the feeding strategy of tsetse. A model is presented that allows for death of tsetse by starvation if they do not succeed in feeding within a fixed time (set at 6 days in the first instance) and for mortality specifically associated with feeding. In addition there is background mortality that applies to all flies at all times. The model is used to compute the individual life-time fertility (number of female puparia per female) as a function of the probability of obtaining a meal (indicated by field data to be very high, usually {\textgreater} 0.85 per day) and the day on which flies start to search for a meal. We suggest that the feeding strategy that would be selected for is that which allows the maximum reproductive output. The model shows that this strategy involves making no attempts to feed for 3-4 days after the previous meal and then attempting to feed with the greatest possible probability until a meal is obtained. The predicted feeding interval, obtained independently of any trapping data, agrees closely with all previous estimates from field studies using a variety of methods. Preliminary results from a laboratory experiment reveal an increased risk of predation of recently fed as compared with hungry tsetse. The lower the actual feeding mortality the more frequently will flies be able to feed should conditions so demand. It is adaptive, however, for tsetse to delay attempting to feed for as long as they can, which is made possible by the near certainty of locating and feeding on a host within 1 day, using their sophisticated sensory systems.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: When taking a bloodmeal from humans, tsetse flies can transmit the trypanosomes responsible for sleeping sickness, or human African trypanosomiasis. While it is commonly assumed that humans must enter the normal woodland habitat of the tsetse in order to have much chance of contacting the flies, recent studies suggested that important contact can occur due to tsetse entering buildings. Hence, we need to know more about tsetse in buildings, and to understand why, when and how they enter such places.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Buildings studied were single storied and comprised a large house with a thatched roof and smaller houses with roofs of metal or asbestos. Each building was unoccupied except for the few minutes of its inspection every two hours, so focusing on the responses of tsetse to the house itself, rather than to humans inside. The composition, and physiological condition of catches of tsetse flies, Glossina morsitans morsitans and G. pallidipes, in the houses and the diurnal and seasonal pattern of catches, were intermediate between these aspects of the catches from artificial refuges and a host-like trap. Several times more tsetse were caught in the large house, as against the smaller structures. Doors and windows seemed about equally effective as entry points. Many of the tsetse in houses were old enough to be potential vectors of sleeping sickness, and some of the flies alighted on the humans that inspected the houses.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: Houses are attractive in themselves. Some of the tsetse attracted seem to be in a host-seeking phase of behavior and others appear to be looking for shelter from high temperatures outside. The risk of contracting sleeping sickness in houses varies according to house design.},

abstract = {Temperature implies contrasting biological causes of demographic aging in poikilotherms. In this work, we used the reliability theory to describe the consistency of mortality with age in moth populations and to show that differentiation in hazard rates is related to extrinsic environmental causes such as temperature. Moreover, experiments that manipulate extrinsic mortality were used to distinguish temperature-related death rates and the pertinence of the Weibull aging model. The Newton-Raphson optimization method was applied to calculate parameters for small samples of ages at death by estimating the maximum likelihoods surfaces using scored gradient vectors and the Hessian matrix. The study reveals for the first time that the Weibull function is able to describe contrasting biological causes of demographic aging for moth populations maintained at different temperature regimes.We demonstrate that at favourable conditions the insect death rate accelerates as age advances, in contrast to the extreme temperatures in which each individual drifts toward death in a linear fashion and has a constant chance of passing away. Moreover, slope of hazard rates shifts towards a constant initial rate which is a pattern demonstrated by systems which are not wearing out (e.g. non-aging) since the failure, or death, is a random event independent of time. This finding may appear surprising, because, traditionally, it was mostly thought as rule that in aging population force of mortality increases exponentially until all individuals have died. Moreover, in relation to other studies, we have not observed any typical decelerating aging patterns at late life (mortality leveling-off), but rather, accelerated hazard rates at optimum temperatures and a stabilized increase at the extremes.In most cases, the increase in aging-related mortality was simulated reasonably well according to the Weibull survivorship model that is applied. Moreover, semi log-probability hazard rate model illustrations and maximum likelihoods may be usefully in defining periods of mortality leveling off and provide clear evidence that environmental variability may affect parameter estimates and insect population failure rate. From a reliability theory standpoint, failure rates vary according to a linear function of age at the extremes indicating that the life system(i.e., population) is able to eliminate earlier failure and/or to keep later failure rates constant. The applied model was able to identify the major correlates of extended longevity and to suggest new ideas for using demographic concepts in both basic and applied population biology and aging.

abstract = {In 1984-1985 insecticide-treated targets were deployed in the 600-km2 Rifa Triangle, Zambezi Valley, Zimbabwe. Trap catches of Glossina pallidipes Austen were modelled using a function combining logistic growth with diffusive movement. A simulation routine was linked to a non-linear least-squares optimization programme and fits optimized with respect to population carrying capacities, rates of growth and movement, and to levels of imposed mortality. In March-September 1984, the overall additional mortality was 2{\%} per day of adult female G. pallidipes, increasing thereafter to 8{\%} per day, due to the deployment of more targets, the onset of the hot, dry season and the ground-spraying of the adjoining Zambezi escarpment with DDT. For G. m. morsitans Westwood the corresponding estimates were 1 and 2{\%} per day. For both species, the deployment of four targets km(-2) in a closed population will ensure eradication. For G. m. morsitans a halving of target efficacy would reduce the killing rate to the point where eradication would be unlikely. Estimated daily displacements were c. 200 m for G. m. morsitans and 660 m for G. pallidipes. The lower rate for G. m. morsitans means that, while targets kill this species less effectively, re-invasion of cleared areas is slower. Targets do not markedly affect robust populations outside the deployment area. The Zambian tsetse population adjacent to the Rifa Triangle declined markedly during the experiment, however, suggesting that it is largely maintained by immigration. The methods developed here will be applied to data from other campaigns with the aim of improving the efficiency of tsetse control programmes.},

Allozyme frequencies were analysed in relation to geographical and climatic factors, and the presence or absence of Trypanosoma cruzi infection. At one locality (Vallegrande, Bolivia), the frequency of 6Pgd-1 was significantly higher in infected (41{\%} of 85) than in uninfected (17{\%} of 83) adult T. infestans, although no such difference was found among nymphs (n = 347). From other localities, only insects infected with T. cruzi were subjected to isozyme analysis. Populations of T. infestans within villages showed panmixia, while genetic differentiation of T. infestans between villages was correlated with the distance between them. The genetic structure of T. infestans natural populations followed an 'isolation by distance' model, involving a series of founder effects followed by genetic drift, rather than adaptation in response to differential selection pressures. This conforms with circumstantial evidence that T. infestans spread, mainly in association with recent human migrations, from a source, probably in southern Bolivia. Isoenzyme characterization of populations of T. infestans could be used to infer sources of re-infestation during the surveillance phase of control programs.},

Repeated feeding on the same host species by a disease vector is likely to increase the within-species disease-transmission risk, but to decrease it between species. An experiment with cattle and reptiles in a stable provides evidence that the species of host selected for the second blood meal in tsetse flies depends on the host encountered for the first blood meal when the between-meal interval is 2 days. This preference disappears when the between-meal interval is extended to 3 days. The energetic advantages of this acquired preference and its importance in trypanosomoses epidemiology are discussed.},

The ovarian age and uterine content were recorded, as were the lengths (l(1), l(2) and l(u)) of the largest and second largest oocyte, and of any uterine inclusion. Major abnormalities and abnormal spermathecal contents were found in {\textless} 0.1{\%} of all flies dissected. Apparent abortions rates varied significantly between dissectors and occurred at frequencies of 0.8-4.5{\%} in G. m. morsitans and 0.3-2.8{\%} in G. pallidipes. The lowest estimates give the best picture of the field situation. Abortion rates were higher in flies caught on electric nets than in trapped flies where the rate was only 0.15{\%}, indicating that reproductive losses are negligible for most of the year at Rekomitjie. The rates did, however, increase to {\textgreater} 2{\%} when mean temperatures exceeded 27 degrees C and flies were captured in artificial refuges.

In this paper, we develop methods for estimating HIV incidence rates using multiple biomarkers in biological samples collected from a cross-sectional survey. An advantage of the method is that it does not require longitudinal follow-up of individuals. We use assays for BED, avidity, viral load, and CD4 cell count data from clade B samples collected in several US epidemiologic cohorts between 1987 and 2010. Considering issues of accuracy, cost, and implementation, we identify optimal multiassay algorithms for estimating incidence. We find that the multiple-biomarker approach to cross-sectional HIV incidence estimation corrects the significant deficiencies of currently available approaches and is a potentially powerful and practical tool for HIV surveillance.},

abstract = {The extent of pigmentation of the abdominal bands of Glossina pallidipes Aust. was studied in specimens emerging in the laboratory from puparia maintained at constant temperature and a range of relative humidities and derived from females collected in the field at Shinyanga, Tanganyika. An index of pigmentation was obtained by regarding the bands as consisting in all of 15 zones, each carrying a score of 1. The index was closely dependent on the humidity experienced during pupal development, almost full pigmentation being produced in saturated air and almost complete suppression of it in dry air; it is inversely related to size and little affected in nearly saturated air by temperatures below 28°C. during pupal development, although still higher temperatures reduce it quite sharply. In flies collected in the field throughout the year, most of those taken towards the end of the rains (March and April) fell into the darker pigment categories; as the dry season advanced the distribution tended to become bimodal, with the darker mode relatively steady at an index of about 12 and the paler mode moving progressively down the scale, reaching an index of about 5 in October and then disappearing. December and January collections (rainy season) were again unimodal, resembling those of March. It is suggested that these changes reflect the use of two types of larviposition site, the darker mode representing pupae from the evergreen thickets along the drainage lines and the lighter mode those from semi-deciduous thickets on the eluvial slopes, and that during the dry season the soil-space humidity in the latter sites may reach levels inimical to survival. The depth to which larvae of G. pallidipes burrow appears to be related to the temperature, and perhaps the humidity, obtaining at the time of larviposition. The possible effect of humidity on coloration was tested in four other species of tsetse fly, namely G. swynnertoni Aust., G. morsitans Westw., G. palpalis fuscipes Newst. and G. longipennis Corti. Only G. swynnertoni gave indications of some slight effect. {\textcopyright} 1960, Cambridge University Press. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Six experimental populations of D. pseudoobscura, all begun from the same genetically diverse group of founders, were kept at three temperatures spanning much of the tolerable range for this species. Two populations were kept at 16 C, two at 25 C, and two at 27 C. Wing length, an accurate index of body size in D. pseudoobscura, was studied after the populations had been maintained for 1.5, 6, and 12 years. No genetic divergence in wing length was evident at 1.5 years, while at 6 years wing length was significantly larger in the populations at 16 C than in the populations at 25 C and 27 C. At 12 years the pattern of divergence was even clearer: wing length was genetically much larger in the one remaining population at 16 C than in the two at 25 C, and in turn wing length was much larger in the two populations at 25 C than in the two at 27 C. The genetic divergence in wing length among the populations was a large proportion-about 40{\%} -of the total phenotypic variation in this character over the temperature interval 16 C to 27 C. There was ample genetic and phenotypic variance in wing length in the populations, and the clear association of this index of body size with environmental temperature makes it likely that selection has favored relatively larger size at the lower temperatures. The association between body size and temperature in the experimental populations is similar to that observed in natural populations of several Drosophila species. Thus the temperature-related selective forces acting on body size in the laboratory may well be similar to those which act in nature.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Area-wide integrated pest management strategies that include a sterile insect technique component have been successfully used to eradicate tsetse fly populations in the past. To ensure the success of the sterile insect technique, the released males must be adequately sterile and be able to compete with their native counterparts in the wild. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS In the present study the radiation sensitivity of colonised Glossina brevipalpis Newstead (Diptera; Glossinidae) males, treated either as adults or pupae, was assessed. The mating performance of the irradiated G. brevipalpis males was assessed in walk-in field cages. Glossina brevipalpis adults and pupae were highly sensitive to irradiation, and a dose of 40 Gy and 80 Gy induced 93{\%} and 99{\%} sterility respectively in untreated females that mated with males irradiated as adults. When 37 to 41 day old pupae were exposed to a dose of 40 Gy, more than 97{\%} sterility was induced in untreated females that mated with males derived from irradiated pupae. Males treated as adults with a dose up to 80 Gy were able to compete successfully with untreated fertile males for untreated females in walk-in field cages. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE The data emanating from this field cage study indicates that, sterile male flies derived from the colony of G. brevipalpis maintained at the Agricultural Research Council-Onderstepoort Veterinary Institute in South Africa are potential good candidates for a campaign that includes a sterile insect technique component. This would need to be confirmed by open field studies.},

Structured questionnaires were administered to a total of 1490 consenting participants. Of the respondents, 924 (62{\%}) knew sleeping sickness, and 807 (87.3{\%}) knew the right place to seek healthcare. Of 924 who knew sleeping sickness, 386 (42{\%}) said the disease was present in the areas they live. Most respondents (85.4{\%}) knew that sleeping sickness infections were acquired in the bush and forest. The most common (69.3{\%}) sources of information about sleeping sickness were relatives and friends. Symptoms of sleeping sickness mentioned included abnormal sleep (45.2{\%}), fever (35.3{\%}), body malaise (14.5{\%}), headache (7.6{\%}) and lymph node enlargement (6.1{\%}). Of 1490 people interviewed 90.4{\%} knew tsetse flies and 89.8{\%} had been bitten by tsetse flies. The majority (86.6{\%}) of the respondents knew that sleeping sickness is transmitted through a tsetse bite. Activities that exposed people to tsetse bites included working in tsetse infested bushes/forests, grazing livestock in tsetse infested areas and hunting game animals. In conclusion, communities living in and around SENAPA were knowledgeable about tsetse and sleeping sickness. The communities can thus understand and support community based tsetse and sleeping sickness control programmes to ensure success.},

abstract = {According to life-history theory, growth rates are subject to strong directional selection due to reproductive and survival advantages associated with large adult body size. Yet, growth is commonly observed to occur at rates lower than the maximum that is physiologically possible and intrinsic growth rates often vary among populations. This implies that slower growth is favoured under certain conditions. Realized growth rate is thus the result of a compromise between the costs and advantages of growing rapidly, and the optimal rate of growth is not equivalent to the fundamental maximum rate. The ecological and evolutionary factors inﬂuencing growth rate are reviewed, with particular emphasis on how growth might be constrained by direct ﬁtness costs. Costs of accelerating growth might contribute to the variance in ﬁtness that is not attributable to age or size at maturity, as well as to the variation in life-history strategies observed within and among species. Two main approaches have been taken to study the ﬁtness trade-offs relating to growth rate. First, environmental manipulations can be used to produce treatment groups with different rates of growth. Second, common garden experiments can be used to compare ﬁtness correlates among populations with different intrinsic growth rates. Data from these studies reveal a number of potential costs for growth over both the short and long term. In order to acquire the energy needed for faster growth, animals must increase food intake. Accordingly, in many taxa, the major constraint on growth rate appears to arise from the trade-off between predation risk and foraging effort. However, growth rates are also frequently observed to be submaximal in the absence of predation, suggesting that growth trajectories also impact ﬁtness via other channels, such as the reallocation of ﬁnite resources between growth and other traits and functions. Despite the prevalence of submaximal growth, even when predators are absent, there is surprisingly little evidence to date demonstrating predator-independent costs of growth acceleration. Evidence that does exist indicates that such costs may be most apparent under stressful conditions. Future studies should examine more closely the link between patterns of resource allocation to traits in the adult organism and lifetime ﬁtness. Changes in body composition at maturation, for example, may determine the outcome of trade-offs between reproduction and survival or between early and late reproduction. A number of design issues for studies investigating costs of growth that are imposed over the long term are discussed, along with suggestions for alternative approaches. Despite these issues, identifying costs of growth acceleration may ﬁll a gap in our understanding of life-history evolution: the relationships between growth rate, the environment, and ﬁtness may contribute substantially to the diversiﬁcation of life histories in nature.},

However, striking data, largely from the biomedical literature, show that environmental effects experienced even before conception can be transmissible to subsequent generations. Here, we review the growing evidence from natural systems for these cross-generational effects of early life conditions, showing that they can be generated by diverse environmental stressors, affect offspring in many ways and can be transmitted directly or indirectly by both parental lines for several generations. In doing so, we emphasize why early life might be so sensitive to the transmission of environmentally induced effects across generations. We also summarize recent theoretical advancements within the field of developmental plasticity, and discuss how parents might assemble different 'internal' and 'external' cues, even from the earliest stages of life, to instruct their investment decisions in offspring. In doing so, we provide a preliminary framework within the context of adaptive plasticity for understanding inter-generational phenomena that arise from early life conditions.},

These capabilities make them ideal targets for developing novel methods of insect disease vector control. Little is known about the nature of SFPs in the viviparous tsetse flies (Diptera: Glossinidae), vectors of Human and Animal African trypanosomiasis. In tsetse, male ejaculate is assembled into a capsule-like spermatophore structure visible post-copulation in the female uterus. We applied high-throughput approaches to uncover the composition of the spermatophore in Glossina morsitans morsitans. We found that both male accessory glands and testes contribute to its formation. The male accessory glands produce a small number of abundant novel proteins with yet unknown functions, in addition to enzyme inhibitors and peptidase regulators. The testes contribute sperm in addition to a diverse array of less abundant proteins associated with binding, oxidoreductase/transferase activities, cytoskeletal and lipid/carbohydrate transporter functions. Proteins encoded by female-biased genes are also found in the spermatophore. About half of the proteins display sequence conservation relative to other Diptera, and low similarity to SFPs from other studied species, possibly reflecting both their fast evolutionary pace and the divergent nature of tsetse's viviparous biology},

The model is currently limited to gallery forest habitat inhabited by Glossina palpalisgambiensis in the dry season in the sub-humid zone of West Africa. The control methods modelled were traps and targets (TT), insecticide-treated livestock (ITL), and the sterile insect technique (SIT). Both distance dispersed (up to 800 m) and percent of flies dispersing each day (up to 60 {\%}) increased the efficiency of control by TT. Most of this increase occurred for low values of both distance dispersed and percent dispersing, but the increase continued up to the limits tried. The daily movement of cattle assisted the control program and when movement was considerable (up to 600 m daily) the effects were greater than the effects of tsetse dispersal. Random dispersal decreased aggregation and equilibrium population size, and thus also increased the efficiency of SIT. Dispersal that was mostly oriented towards clumps was of much less value for SIT but acted on TT and ITL similarly to random dispersal. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Society of Population Ecology and Springer.},

We investigate age-related changes in standard metabolic rate (SMR) and its repeatability, using flow-through respirometry, for a variety of feeding, gender and pregnancy classes during early adult development in laboratory-reared individuals of the tsetse fly, Glossina pallidipes. Standard metabolic rate (144-635 $\mu$W) was generally within 22{\%} of previous estimates, though lower than the values found using closed system respirometry. There was no significant difference between the genders, but metabolic rate increased consistently with age, probably owing to flight muscle development. Repeatability of metabolic rate was generally high (r=0.6-0.9), but not in younger teneral adults and pregnant females (r≈0.05-0.4). In these individuals, low repeatability values are a consequence of muscle or in utero larval development.

Large losses due to nagana have been reported; and this indicates the importance of tsetse control to avoid estimated losses. This study assessed the knowledge of tsetse and control practices, attitude towards control practices against tsetse, and the actual control practices used by the local communities in Serengeti District near the Serengeti National Park (SENAPA). Data for this study were collected using various methods. An interview schedule was administered to 70 randomly selected households, 12 focus group discussions with men and women farmers, and four key informant interviews with technical staff were held. The data were analysed using largely descriptive statistics and content analysis method. The farmers had inadequate knowledge of tsetse such that they confused them with other similar flies. On the other hand, they demonstrated knowledge of tsetse control measures, and these included some, which were not among those recommended by the extension staff. While the attitude towards control methods was positive most of the farmers did not use the recommended methods largely due to the cost associated with them. This suggests that the positive attitude towards a recommendation by itself is not sufficient to influence its use. Besides, poor management of dipping facilities for tsetse control and inadequate supervision by district staff impacted on the quality of services offered. Thus enabling local community members to have clear knowledge of tsetse flies is an important starting point for mobilizing them to take appropriate control measures against tsetse. Also, district authorities need to take an active role in monitoring the performance of the dipping facilities in the district by taking up appropriate measures to ensure quality control of services offered. Moreover, there is need for the district authorities and the central government to address the challenges which privatization of veterinary services posed to animal health and the wellbeing of people who depend on livestock for their livelihood.},

abstract = {Studies were made of the behaviour of Glossina pallidipes Austen and G. morsitans morsitans Westwood during the hot season (September-November) in Zimbabwe, and attributes of samples of tsetse from refuges, odour-baited traps, targets and mobile baits were compared. Various arrangements of electric nets were used to study tsetse as they entered or left artificial refuges. The peak time of entry into a refuge varied between 0800 h and 1400 h and coincided with the time when the air temperature reached 32 degrees C; the response was stronger if 32 degrees C occurred earlier in the day. The peak time of exit varied between 1500 h and 1700 h, being significantly later on hotter days, but did not show a clear temperature threshold. Micro-meteorological measurements showed that refuges were significantly cooler than the surrounding riverine woodland during the day but warmer at night. There was no significant difference between the air temperatures in leafless mopane woodland and semi-evergreen riverine woodland during the day but at night the riverine woodland was significantly cooler. Combining the micro-meteorological data with the estimated local movements of tsetse suggested that during the hot season, tsetse experienced temperatures 2 degrees C cooler than the daily mean in a Stevenson screen located in mopane woodland. Compared with the catches of tsetse from traps, refuges had higher proportions of G. m. morsitans, males, young flies and females in the later stages of reproduction, and it is suggested that during the hot season, samples from refuges were less biased than traps with respect to species and sex composition, age and reproductive status. During the hot season, tsetse populations declined by c. 90{\%} and although air temperatures exceeded lethal levels (c. 40 degrees C), the refuge-entering responses meant that adult flies probably experienced a maximum of only c. 35 degrees C. It is suggested that the decline in numbers is not due to direct mortality effects of temperature on adults but may be due, in part, to a doubling in the rates of reproductive abnormality during the hot season and an increase in adult mortality related to a temperature-dependent decrease in pupal period.},

abstract = {Given the veterinary and public health impact of vector-borne diseases, there is a clear need to assess the suitability of landscapes for the emergence and spread of these diseases. Current approaches for predicting disease risks neglect key features of the landscape as components of the functional habitat of vectors or hosts, and hence of the pathogen. Empirical-statistical methods do not explicitly incorporate biological mechanisms, whereas current mechanistic models are rarely spatially explicit; both methods ignore the way animals use the landscape (i.e. movement ecology). We argue that applying a functional concept for habitat, i.e. the resource-based habitat concept (RBHC), can solve these issues. The RBHC offers a framework to identify systematically the different ecological resources that are necessary for the completion of the transmission cycle and to relate these resources to (combinations of) landscape features and other environmental factors. The potential of the RBHC as a framework for identifying suitable habitats for vector-borne pathogens is explored and illustrated with the case of bluetongue virus, a midge-transmitted virus affecting ruminants. The concept facilitates the study of functional habitats of the interacting species (vectors as well as hosts) and provides new insight into spatial and temporal variation in transmission opportunities and exposure that ultimately determine disease risks. It may help to identify knowledge gaps and control options arising from changes in the spatial configuration of key resources across the landscape. The RBHC framework may act as a bridge between existing mechanistic and statistical modelling approaches.},

abstract = {Trypanosomiasis has had profound effects on agricultural systems and land use in Africa, mainly since the advent of European settlement, which initiated changes in social and economic patterns which still exist and are accelerating, due to increasing population pressure. Tsetse species of the morsitans group will probably disappear from much of the drier savannahs of Africa - very soon in parts of densely populated West Africa, over a much longer period in extensive underpopulated areas. Well managed conservation areas, such as forest and game reserves, present a special case and could remain as reservoirs ot tsetse and infection for many years to come. Trypanosomiasis control - and in the drier areas tsetse eradication or control is probably generally the best approach - can hurry up the eradication process and to control the species of the palpalis group where they occur. Planned control campaigns could provide the last opportunity for optimal development of virgin resources, or at least to avoid the consequences of the random settlement which would otherwise take place. ADDITIONAL ABSTRACT: Human and animal trypanosomiases (caused by Trypanosoma spp.) have in the past been major constraints to the development of land use in Africa. Rapidly expanding human populations are currently having profound effects on the distribution of Glossina spp., the vectors of these diseases. In some areas, the flies are disappearing, whereas, in others, new man-made habitats are being created, and the encroachment of subsistence farming into areas cleared of the vectors can prevent optimal development of the land. In this paper, the author summarises the relationship between trypanosomiasis control and land use in Africa.

abstract = {The development of simple models for describing the population dynamics of species with overlapping generations is briefly described. The paper then presents a minimally complex simulation model for tsetse populations in which seasonally varying density-independent mortality, generally applied only to the adult stage, is combined with density dependence acting on both puparia and adults. Density dependence regulates population size within limits determined by an interaction between the strength or the density-dependent relationships and the variability of the seasonal density independence. Population data sets for Glossina palpalis and G. morsitans in Nigeria, and G. pallidipes in Kenya are adequately described by the model. Relationships discovered between the density-independent mortality and climatic variables for the Lambwe Valley data set allow predictions of population changes in other sites on the basis of their climatic conditions. Attempts to predict changes in the population of G. pallidipes in Somalia highlight the difficulties of this exercise. A tsetse's demographic response to climate may vary from region to region, making extensive predictions from local data sets difficult. There seems, however, no need to make more complex models to describe observed changes in tsetse populations},

In African leeches from Cameroon, blood was serologically positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis B; blood of Hirudo medicinalis bought in German pharmacies contained up to 11 different species of bacteria. In experiments done at low (3°C) and high (22°, 32°C) temperatures, it was shown that ingested red and white blood cells survive for long periods. The time was prolonged to at least 6 months in cases in which the leeches were stored at 3°C. The same effect occurred with pathogens. Bacteriophages (viruses of bacteria) and bacteria persisted in large numbers for at least 6 months in the gut of experimentally infected leeches. Protozoan parasites such as Toxoplasma gondii, Trypanosoma brucei brucei, or Plasmodium berghei were even capable of reproducting inside the gut of the leech. In the case of Plasmodium parasites, this proceeded at low (3°C) and high (22°C) temperatures until all erythrocytes were used up. these parasites survived as long as the erythrocytes and lymphocytes were of good shape, i.e., around 5-6 weeks p.i. Single stages survived longer, especially at low temperatures. However, electron microscopy studies gave no hint of penetration of such pathogens into the unicellular salivary glands, which would initiate a direct transmission. Such transmission, however, is possible-many fish leeches directly transmit several blood parasites -when the leeches are squeezed during skin attachment or when they are manipulated by dropping salt solution on their backs while they are sucking. Consequently, the leech is a potential vector of many pathogens, especially in regions with an endemic spread of human and/or animal pathogens. {\textcopyright} 1994 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {The Ross-Macdonald model has dominated theory for mosquito-borne pathogen transmission dynamics and control for over a century. The model, like many other basic population models, makes the mathematically convenient assumption that populations are well mixed; i.e., that each mosquito is equally likely to bite any vertebrate host. This assumption raises questions about the validity and utility of current theory because it is in conflict with preponderant empirical evidence that transmission is heterogeneous. Here, we propose a new dynamic framework that is realistic enough to describe biological causes of heterogeneous transmission of mosquito-borne pathogens of humans, yet tractable enough to provide a basis for developing and improving general theory. The framework is based on the ecological context of mosquito blood meals and the fine-scale movements of individual mosquitoes and human hosts that give rise to heterogeneous transmission. Using this framework, we describe pathogen dispersion in terms of individual-level analogues of two classical quantities: vectorial capacity and the basic reproductive number, . Importantly, this framework explicitly accounts for three key components of overall heterogeneity in transmission: heterogeneous exposure, poor mixing, and finite host numbers. Using these tools, we propose two ways of characterizing the spatial scales of transmission—pathogen dispersion kernels and the evenness of mixing across scales of aggregation—and demonstrate the consequences of a model's choice of spatial scale for epidemic dynamics and for estimation of , both by a priori model formulas and by inference of the force of infection from time-series data. Author Summary: Pathogens transmitted by mosquitoes, such as malaria and dengue, are notorious for the biological complexity associated with how they are transmitted within local communities. Yet mathematical models for these pathogens, which are critical tools for making recommendations for control policy, are based around concepts originally designed to describe how molecules interact in chemical systems. To provide those interested in mosquito-borne diseases a more appropriate tool for modeling their transmission, we introduce a mathematical framework that is based on the spatial locations where mosquitoes lay eggs and feed on blood and how mosquitoes and hosts move about those locations. Analysis of this framework shows that the transmission contributions of different hosts and locations can be calculated, and that overall potential for transmission in a community depends on three concepts: heterogeneous exposure (some people bitten by mosquitoes more than others), poor mixing (non-random contacts between hosts and mosquitoes), and finite population sizes (each host can contribute at most one new infection towards the population total). Together, these factors determine critical levels of vaccination coverage to eliminate a pathogen and the spatial areas over which transmission should be modeled and studied in the field. --- "Perkins et al.

Structured questionnaire were administered to 80 respondents and out of these 95{\%} had adequate knowledge about tsetse flies and 79{\%} knew the local names of the fly. The study also revealed that 25.5{\%} of respondents recognized the common hideouts of tsetse to be the grazing areas near the reserves 29{\%} along rivers and 20.4{\%} in bushes and forests.  Twenty four percent of respondents knew the clinical signs of African Animal Trypanosomiasis (AAT) which included rough coat, emaciation (21{\%}), diarrhea (13.3{\%}) and loss of appetite (11.9{\%}). Other mentioned disease symptoms which had small proportions included miscarriages, coughing, reduced milk yield and break tail. Ninety six percent of respondents ranked Animal Trypanosomiasis the first among other existing animal diseases in the area including Contagious Bovine Pleuropneumonia (CBPP), Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD), East Coast Fever (ECF) and Anaplasmosis. Chemotherapy was the most practiced method to control trypanosomiasis in the western Serengeti. Cattle owners used isometamedium chloride (samorin) and dimenazine aceturate (berenil) to treat sick animals. Economic losses caused by the disease in their animals were identified to be deaths, reduced milk production and income. Lack of enough resources to contribute to the maintenance of cattle dips and the grazing of animals inside the reserves especially during the dry season when there was shortage of pastures outside the reserves were the main constraints associated with cattle productivity in the area.

abstract = {BACKGROUND Schistosomiasis is a snail-borne disease endemic in sub-Saharan Africa transmitted by freshwater snails. The distribution of schistosomiasis coincides with that of the intermediate hosts as determined by climatic and environmental factors. The aim of this paper was to model the spatial and seasonal distribution of suitable habitats for Bulinus globosus and Biomphalaria pfeifferi snail species (intermediate hosts for Schistosoma haematobium and Schistosoma mansoni, respectively) in the Ndumo area of uMkhanyakude district, South Africa. METHODS Maximum Entropy (Maxent) modelling technique was used to predict the distribution of suitable habitats for B. globosus and B. pfeifferi using presence-only datasets with ≥ 5 and ≤ 12 sampling points in different seasons. Precipitation, maximum and minimum temperatures, Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalised Difference Water Index (NDWI), pH, slope and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) were the background variables in the Maxent models. The models were validated using the area under the curve (AUC) and omission rate. RESULTS The predicted suitable habitats for intermediate snail hosts varied with seasons. The AUC for models in all seasons ranged from 0.71 to 1 and the prediction rates were between 0.8 and 0.9. Although B. globosus was found at more localities in the Ndumo area, there was also evidence of cohabiting with B. pfiefferi at some of the locations. NDWI had significant contribution to the models in all seasons. CONCLUSION The Maxent model is robust in snail habitat suitability modelling even with small dataset of presence-only sampling sites. Application of the methods and design used in this study may be useful in developing a control and management programme for schistosomiasis in the Ndumo area.},

Only people who lived in the area for 1 month believed that witchcraft and bad water transmitted sleeping sickness (0.9{\%} and 0.1{\%} respectively). Approximately 73{\%} reported tsetse flies to be uncommon in their villages. Just 2{\%} believed trypanosomiasis to be a leading disease because its treatment often requires a long hospitalization. Most people (74{\%}) thought malaria to be the most serious disease, because it occurs frequently and kills many people. Tsetse flies become ubiquitous during the rainy season. Further the Tropical Disease Research Centre in Ndola, Zambia has found extremely high tsetse densities along access roads and paths connecting villages. The researchers planned to use these results in developing a parasite control project in the area.

abstract = {A study on populations of Glossina morsitans morsitans Westwood on Antelope Island, Lake Kariba, Zimbabwe provided Jolly-Seber (J-S) mark-recapture estimates of adult survival and Moran curve estimates of the overall survival of all developmental stages. For females, Moran survival estimates derived using ox fly-round catches showed similar trends to, but were more variable than, those calculated from J-S population estimates. Regression of one set on the other removed only 26{\%} of the variance. Undue emphasis should not be placed on small changes in Moran survival estimates based on sequences of catches. Catch data cannot provide Moran estimates of male survival probabilities and no comparison is thus possible with estimates from the J-S data. The J-S and the Moran approaches were combined to estimate survival probabilities of the immature stages of male and female tsetse. The overall survival per three-week period averaged 45{\%} for males and 59{\%} for females, comprising mature adult survivals of 27 and 46{\%}, and pooled survivals of immature stages of 59 and 77{\%}, respectively. The high survival of immature flies is due to the sheltered, inactive nature of pupal life. Adult and overall survival probabilities were highly correlated in males (r(2) = 0.61) but less so in females (r(2) = 0.24) where capture rates were lower and variance in the results greater. Immature and overall survival was more highly correlated for both sexes, with r(2) = 0.77 and 0.53 for males and females respectively. When a fixed pupal mortality of 1{\%} per day was assumed, estimates of the survival of young adult males suggested that these were even lower than the survival of mature flies at the harshest times of the year, but were not markedly different when overall survival was high. Assuming equal mortality in all adults enabled the estimation of pupal survival. These had high variances but there was no evidence of any difference between the survival probabilities of male and female pupae.},

abstract = {The tsetse fly complex (Glossina spp.) is widely recognized as a key contributor to the African continent's continuing struggle to emerge from deep economic, social, and political problems. Vector control, the backbone of intensive efforts to remove the human and livestock trypanosomosis problem, has been typified by spectacular successes and failures. There is widespread agreement that integrated vector control, combined with direct disease treatment and prevention, has to play a major role in alleviating the tsetse burden in Africa. Mathematical and computer-based simulation models have been extensively used to try to understand how best to manage these control efforts. Such models in ecology have been helpful in giving broad generalizations about population dynamics and control. Unfortunately, in many ways they have inadequately addressed key aspects of the fly's biology and ecology, particularly the spatio-temporal variability of its habitats. These too must factor in any control efforts. Mathematical models have inherent limitations that must be considered in their use for control programs. In this review, we consider some of the controversies being debated within the field of ecology and evolution about the use of mathematical models and critically review several models that have been influential in structuring tsetse control efforts. We also make recommendations on the appropriate role that mathematical and simulation models should play when used for these purposes. Management programs are often vulnerable to naively using these models inappropriately. The questions raised in this review will apply broadly to many conservation and area-wide pest control programs with an ecological component relying on mathematical and computer simulation models to inform their decisions.},

abstract = {Cryptic female choice may be common among crustaceans , but few studies have thoroughly examined it in this diverse taxonomic group. Herein, we summarize current genetic evidence for multiple paternity and skewed offspring ratios in crustaceans, and document observations that could suggest cryptic female choice. Behaviors indicative of cryptic female choice have been reported from numerous crustacean taxa (e.g., crayfish , hermit crabs , isopods ), showcasing a diverse array of behavioral mechanisms such as failed copulations, spermatophore removal , selective sperm passage, chemical signaling , adjusting duration of receptivity, delayed copulation , or discriminative reproductive investment in favor of preferred males. We highlight a few case studies, in which a suite of different cryptic behaviors permits females to maintain control over fertilizations. The possibility of selective sperm–egg interactions is briefly discussed, and parallels to other aquatic invertebrates are drawn revealing similar cryptic choice mechanisms. The disparity of body forms and reproductive strategies found in crustaceans and the fact that they inhabit many different habitats with variable selective environments makes them an ideal model taxon for future studies on cryptic female choice .},

abstract = {Hypothermia is a thermoregulatory response to systemic inflammation that is often regarded as maladaptive to the host. However, rodents show regulated hypothermia (that is, a selection of cool ambient temperature) during systemic inflammation that correlates with enhanced survival, supporting an adaptive value to this response. The mechanisms regulating hypothermia are not fully understood, but cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukins (ILs) and interferon-gamma have been shown to induce or modulate hypothermia. A review of the literature suggests that TNF-alpha functions as an endogenous cryogen (i.e., induces hypothermia), whereas IL-10 modulates TNF-alpha production and/or release as a mechanism of hypothermia attenuation. IL-1beta and IL-6 are typically regarded as endogenous pyrogens, but may induce hypothermia during viral and bacterial inflammation. A role for endogenous IFN-gamma in hypothermia has not been demonstrated, but injection of this cytokine potentiates hypothermia through augmented production of other cytokines. It is clear that additional research is required in this area. Suggested areas for future research include a determination of the final mediator of hypothermia and its specific anatomical site of action as well as the role of cytokines in the regulation of hypothermia under non-inflammatory conditions.},

abstract = {Survival and population growth rates in several species of Afro-Palaearctic migrant have been shown to correlate with rainfall regimes and/or vegetation level on their African wintering grounds, implying that seasonal food resources may contribute to population limitation. Here we explore the generality of this relationship across 16 migrant species breeding in England by investigating the proportion of variability in annual population change that is explained by the impact of environmental variables on wintering and staging grounds over 25- and 40-year time periods. In the 40-year time-series, rainfall in the arid Sahel region of West Africa had the strongest and most consistent effects on migrant populations, positively influencing the population growth rate in six of nine species which winter in this area and in three of seven species that use the region during their migratory passage but which over-winter further south. The effects of precipitation in other regions of Africa and satel- lite-derived measures of vegetation quality in all regions were weaker and less consistent in direction. Over the 25-year period for which data on both rainfall and vegetation were available, 12 of the 16 study species showed significant weather effects; the mean deviance explained by environ- mental variables among these 12 species was 32 {\%}, increasing to 41 {\%} when density-dependence was added to the models. For the 40-year time period, 11 species showed significant effects of rainfall, with the mean deviance explained by environmental variables of 14 {\%} (23 {\%} including density-dependence). Our results demonstrate that in many long-distance migrant species, precipitation in the Sahel is a significant driver of changes in abundance at the large-scale population level.},

abstract = {The presence of ecdysteroids during the larval life cycle and in the abdomens and ovaries of pregnant tsetse flies was established using radioimmunoassay. The hormone titre rises on day 9 of the larval life cycle 2–3 days after the hardening of the polypneustic lobes, mouthparts, phragma and anus. How initiation of tanning of the cuticle of the polypneustic lobes and later the puparium of tsetse fly is regulated is discussed as these events are separated in time by several days. It would seem to be unlikely that the pyrokinin neuropeptide, which is responsible for initiating the events that lead up to pupariation, is also involved 2–3 days earlier in the life cycle. The objective was to ascertain whether 14C-l-p-tyrosine enters the lobe cuticle in vivo and in vitro much faster than into integument cuticle on the 7th day of the pregnancy cycle. The result showed that the uptake of tyrosine into the lobes was 11–12 times faster than into the rest of the cuticle. Some evidence is presented that haemocytes underlying the epidermis are involved in overcoming the barrier to uptake of the phenolic compounds required for sclerotization of the lobes. Pupariation could be retarded by physical means such as ligaturing of the larvae. To try to break this inhibition (retardation) of pupariation in ligatured larvae, 14C-l-p-tyrosine metabolites were injected, with and without ecdysteroids, into the anterior of ligated larvae. The result of this experiment showed that the steroid hormone did not overcome the inhibition but neither does injecting tyrosine, dihydroxyphenylalanine, dopamine or tyramine. Evidence obtained from chromatography and electrophoresis indicated that N-acetylation of dopamine did not occur in the haemolymph of larvae that were artificially retarded. This impact raises the possibility that N-acetyltransferase and acetyl-coenzyme A could be released in pre-pupae after the action of a neuropeptide breaks the retardation of tanning.},

abstract = { The viviparous tsetse fly utilizes proline as a hemolymph-borne energy source. In tsetse, biosynthesis of proline from alanine involves the enzyme alanine-glyoxylate aminotransferase (AGAT), which requires pyridoxal phosphate (vitamin B 6 ) as a cofactor. This vitamin can be synthesized by tsetse's obligate symbiont, Wigglesworthia glossinidia . In this study, we examined the role of Wigglesworthia -produced vitamin B 6 for maintenance of proline homeostasis, specifically during the energetically expensive lactation period of the tsetse's reproductive cycle. We found that expression of agat , as well as genes involved in vitamin B 6 metabolism in both host and symbiont, increases in lactating flies. Removal of symbionts via antibiotic treatment of flies (aposymbiotic) led to hypoprolinemia, reduced levels of vitamin B 6 in lactating females, and decreased fecundity. Proline homeostasis and fecundity recovered partially when aposymbiotic tsetse were fed a diet supplemented with either yeast or Wigglesworthia extracts. RNA interference-mediated knockdown of agat in wild-type flies reduced hemolymph proline levels to that of aposymbiotic females. Aposymbiotic flies treated with agat short interfering RNA (siRNA) remained hypoprolinemic even upon dietary supplementation with microbial extracts or B vitamins. Flies infected with parasitic African trypanosomes display lower hemolymph proline levels, suggesting that the reduced fecundity observed in parasitized flies could result from parasite interference with proline homeostasis. This interference could be manifested by competition between tsetse and trypanosomes for vitamins, proline, or other factors involved in their synthesis. Collectively, these results indicate that the presence of Wigglesworthia in tsetse is critical for the maintenance of proline homeostasis through vitamin B 6 production. },

abstract = {P{\textgreater}1. How much should an individual invest in reproduction as it grows older? Answering this question involves determining whether individuals measure their age as the time left for future reproduction or as the rate of deterioration in their state. Theory suggests that in the former case individuals should increase their allocation of resources to reproduction as opportunities for future breeding dwindle, and terminally invest when they breed for the last time. In the latter case they should reduce their investment in reproduction with age, either through adaptive reproductive restraint or as a passive by-product of senescence. 2. Here we present the results of experiments on female burying beetles, Nicrophorus vespilloides, in which we independently manipulated the perceived risk of death (by activating the immune system) and the extent of deterioration in state (by changing age of first reproduction and/or prior investment in reproduction). 3. We found that the risk of death and state each independently influenced the extent of reproductive investment. Specifically, we found a state-dependent decline in reproductive investment as females grew older that could be attributed to both adaptive reproductive restraint and senescence. A perceived increase in the risk of death, induced by activation of the immune system, caused females to switch from a strategy of reproductive restraint to terminal investment. Nevertheless, absolute reproductive investment was lower in older females, indicating constraints of senescence. 4. Our results show that a decline in reproductive investment with age does not necessarily constitute evidence of reproductive senescence but can also result from adaptive reproductive restraint. 5. Our results further suggest that the extent of reproductive investment is dependent on several different intrinsic cues and that the particular blend of cues available at any given age can yield very different patterns of investment. Perhaps this explains why age-related reproductive investment patterns seen in nature are so diverse.},

abstract = {Life-history theory assumes that reproduction and lifespan are constrained by trade-offs which prevent their simultaneous increase. Recently, there has been considerable interest in the possibility that this cost of reproduction is mediated by oxidative stress. However, empirical tests of this theory have yielded equivocal support. We carried out a meta-analysis to examine associations between reproduction and oxidative damage across markers and tissues. We show that oxidative damage is positively associated with reproductive effort across females of various species. Yet paradoxically, categorical comparisons of breeders versus non-breeders reveal that transition to the reproductive state is associated with a step-change reduction in oxidative damage in certain tissues and markers. Developing offspring may be particularly sensitive to harm caused by oxidative damage in mothers. Therefore, such reductions could potentially function to shield reproducing mothers, gametes and developing offspring from oxidative insults that inevitably increase as a consequence of reproductive effort. According to this perspective, we hypothesise that the cost of reproduction is mediated by dual impacts of maternally-derived oxidative damage on mothers and offspring, and that mothers may be selected to diminish such damage. Such oxidative shielding may explain why many existing studies have concluded that reproduction has little or no oxidative cost. Future advance in life-history theory therefore needs to take account of potential transgenerational impacts of the mechanisms underlying life-history trade-offs.},

abstract = {Large-scale digitization of museum specimens, particularly of insect collections, is becoming commonplace. Imaging increases the accessibility of collections and decreases the need to handle individual, often fragile, specimens. Another potential advantage of digitization is to make it easier to conduct morphometric analyses, but the accuracy of such methods needs to be tested. Here we compare morphometric measurements of scanned images of dragonfly wings to those obtained using other, more traditional, methods. We assume that the destructive method of removing and slide-mounting wings provides the most accurate method of measurement because it eliminates error due to wing curvature. We show that, for dragonfly wings, hand measurements of pinned specimens and digital measurements of scanned images are equally accurate relative to slide-mounted hand measurements. Since destructive slide-mounting is unsuitable for museum collections, and there is a risk of damage when hand measuring fragile pinned specimens, we suggest that the use of scanned images may also be an appropriate method to collect morphometric data from other collected insect species.},

This article utilises human case data from a high-endemicity region of the Democratic Republic of Congo in conjunction with a suite of novel mechanistic mathematical models to address the effectiveness of on-going active screening and treatment programmes and compute the likely time to elimination as a public health problem (i.e. {\textless}1 case per 10,000 per year).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: The model variants address uncertainties surrounding transmission of HAT infection including heterogeneous risk of exposure to tsetse bites, non-participation of certain groups during active screening campaigns and potential animal reservoirs of infection.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Model fitting indicates that variation in human risk of tsetse bites and participation in active screening play a key role in transmission of this disease, whilst the existence of animal reservoirs remains unclear. Active screening campaigns in this region are calculated to have been effective, reducing the incidence of new human infections by 52-53 {\%} over a 15-year period (1998-2012). However, projections of disease dynamics in this region indicate that the elimination goal may not be met until later this century (2059-2092) under the current intervention strategy.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Improvements to active detection, such as screening those who have not previously participated and raising overall screening levels, as well as beginning widespread vector control in the area have the potential to ensure successful and timely elimination.},

The techniques described include those which deal with changes in the reproductive system, as well as somatic changes which take place with age. They also include techniques based on changes induced by wear and tear. Follicular relics found in different orders of insects are described, and their origin, fate and relative usefulness in age-grading studies are discussed. Attention is drawn to the formation of anomalous or aberrant dilatations, particularly ones formed as a result of follicle resorption. The suitability of the various techniques to the study of different insect species is compared, and the advantages of using more than one type of age-grading method in the study of one species are discussed. Enough detail of each technique is given to permit field workers to choose and apply the technique most suitable for the study of the insect of their choice, and for the degree of accuracy required by them. Lists of species which have been studied by particular age-grading techniques, or combinations of them, are given. Finally, examples are cited of the types of problems entomologists have sought to solve, often successfully, using age-grading methods.},

Several studies are nowadays devoted to finding the parameters that would allow a precise evaluation of the health status of ageing patients. Cardio-vascular diseases (CVD) represent the main co-morbidity of the ageing process. The aim of the present study was the assessment of ghrelin dynamics in serum samples obtained from patients with different age, with or without cardio-vascular diseases. Our results show a negative association between the age of the selected patients and the ghrelin level in blood samples. Also, the cardio-vascular patients were characterized by a lower level of ghrelin compared to healthy subjects. Results lead to the conclusion that ghrelin is a reliable marker for the cardio-vascular risk and that ghrelin modulation should be considered as a novel therapeutic strategy.},

abstract = {Fatty acid composition of lipids from adult Glossina morsitans was unaffected by an in vitro fed diet of cow blood which induces production of under-sized offspring compared to that of flies fed on a superior diet of pig blood. The commonest fatty acids were C16:0, C16:1 and C18:1 and only small differences in proportions were detected between virgin and pregnant females. Rate of lipid accumulation by males and females was the same and was unaffected by diet, but males achieved a maximum of 2.5 mg on day 9 while both virgin and fertilised females reached a maximum of 5,0 mg on day 14 of adult life. Lipid content of pregnant flies then fell to 3.0 mg on the day of larviposition and accumulation began again. A cow blood diet reduced the extent to which the lipids were utilised for larval growth and this was reflected in an altered secretory activity cycle in the female uterine gland. However, no effect on the growth of adult fat body was detectable in such flies. Mating and fertilisation, which influence reproductive events through activity of the endrocine system do not seem to affect the acquisition of lipid reserves by female Glossina. However, they clearly exert considerable influence over distribution of such reserves between fat body and uterine gland, which distribution is also affected by diet. {\textcopyright} 1979.},

abstract = {In 1984-1985 insecticide-treated targets were deployed in the 600-km2 Rifa Triangle, Zambezi Valley, Zimbabwe. Trap catches of Glossina pallidipes Austen were modelled using a function combining logistic growth with diffusive movement. A simulation routine was linked to a non-linear least-squares optimization programme and fits optimized with respect to population carrying capacities, rates of growth and movement, and to levels of imposed mortality. In March-September 1984, the overall additional mortality was 2{\%} per day of adult female G. pallidipes, increasing thereafter to 8{\%} per day, due to the deployment of more targets, the onset of the hot, dry season and the ground-spraying of the adjoining Zambezi escarpment with DDT. For G. m. morsitans Westwood the corresponding estimates were 1 and 2{\%} per day. For both species, the deployment of four targets km(-2) in a closed population will ensure eradication. For G. m. morsitans a halving of target efficacy would reduce the killing rate to the point where eradication would be unlikely. Estimated daily displacements were c. 200 m for G. m. morsitans and 660 m for G. pallidipes. The lower rate for G. m. morsitans means that, while targets kill this species less effectively, re-invasion of cleared areas is slower. Targets do not markedly affect robust populations outside the deployment area. The Zambian tsetse population adjacent to the Rifa Triangle declined markedly during the experiment, however, suggesting that it is largely maintained by immigration. The methods developed here will be applied to data from other campaigns with the aim of improving the efficiency of tsetse control programmes.},

A simple, low-cost approach to estimating population ageing was introduced based on a modified version of the captive cohort method – a technique developed earlier (Carey et al., Aging Cell, 7, 426–437, 2008) in which information on the remaining lifespans of live-captured medflies of unknown age is used to estimate the overall population age structure. 2. To test this approach approximately 1200 medflies near Volos, Greece were live captured from daily sampling over a 3-month field season. 3. This simplified method reported: (i) an extraordinary post-capture longevity of wild medflies in early season ({\textgreater}200 days in longest lived); (ii) a decrease of 50–75 days in the mean longevity from early-season to late-season flies; (iii) seasonality of frailty as indicated by the shorter-lived flies in late autumn; (iv) cessation of fly emergence in late season as indicated by the absence of long-lived individuals (indicating newly emerged at capture) sampled in the autumn; and (v) increase in mean age from about 20 days in early season to approximately 60 days in late season. 4. The applications of this simplified captive cohort method are discussed, including its use in the analysis of insect vector populations, Drosophila ecology and ageing in the wild, demographic toxicology, and age bias in sampling.},

Here, I apply resource competition theory (RCT) to the exploitation of RNRs and derive four general policies in support of their sustainable and equitable use: (1) regulate resource extraction technology to avoid damage to the resource base; (2) increase efficiency of resource use and reduce waste at every step in the resource supply chain and distribution network; (3) partition ecosystems with the harvesting niche as the basic organizing principle for sustainable management of natural resources by multiple users; and (4) increase negative feedback between consumer and resource to bring about long-term sustainable use. A simple policy framework demonstrates how RCT integrates with other elements of sustainability science to better manage productive ecosystems. Several problem areas of RNR management are discussed in the light of RCT, including tragedy of the commons, overharvesting, resource collapse, bycatch, single species quotas, and simplification of ecosystems. {\textcopyright} 2016 by the Ecological Society of America.},

abstract = {We evaluate the cost-of-reproduction hypothesis in the burying beetle Nicrophorus orbicollis and examine how the importance of this trade-off changes as females age (i.e., the terminal-investment hypothesis). These beetles breed on small vertebrate carcasses, which serve as a food resource for them and their offspring. Consistent with the cost-of-reproduction hypothesis, females manipulated to overproduce offspring suffered a reduction in fecundity and life span when compared to controls, although all reproducing females had reduced life spans compared to nonbreeding females. Older females produced larger broods and allocated less of the carcass to their own body mass and a greater proportion to offspring than did younger females. Resource allocation to offspring increased with age. Females given larger carcasses invested more in current reproduction and less in future reproduction than did females given smaller carcasses. Our results provide unconfounded support for both the cost-of-reproduction hypothesis (i.e., current reproduction constrains future reproductive output) and the terminal-investment hypothesis (i.e., the importance of the trade-off between current and future reproduction declines with age such that allocation to current reproduction should increase as females age).},

A large population of G. pallidipes existed in association with a varied community of game animals in the study area, and the investigation was designed to determine which of the hosts available to G. pallidipes were actively selected and whether the preferred hosts influenced the distribution of the tsetse population. Bushbuck (Tragelaphus scriptus) was found to be the preferred host of G. pallidipes and there was a positive correlation between the distribution of these two species. Buffalo and roan antelope were also selected for food but, because of their behavioural characteristics, neither was continually available to the tsetse population and they had no influence on its distribution.},

abstract = {The taxonomic distribution and evolution of viviparity in Diptera is critically reviewed. The phenomenon ranges from ovoviviparity (eggs deposited at an advanced stage of embryonic development; larva emerges immediately after deposition), through viviparity (larva hatches inside female before deposition) to pupiparity (offspring deposited as pupa). Some Diptera are known to be facultatively viviparous, which is hypothesized to be a step towards the evolution of obligate viviparity. Obligate viviparity is found to comprise unilarviparity (single large larva in maternal uterus) which evolved many times independently, the rare oligolarviparity (more than one but not more than 12 larvae) and multilarviparity (large numbers of developing eggs or larvae in uterus) which is typical for the two largest clades of viviparous Diptera. Unilarviparity is either lecithotrophic (developing larva nourished by yolk of egg) or pseudo-placental (larva nourished by glandular secretions of mother). Viviparity has clearly evolved on many separate occasions in Diptera. It is recorded in 22 families, and this review identifies at least 61 independent origins of viviparity. Six families appear to have viviparity in their ground-plan. Some families have a single evolution of viviparity, others multiple evolutions. Guimaraes' model for the evolution of viviparity in Diptera is tested against phylogenetic information and the adaptive significance of viviparity is reviewed in detail. Possible correlations with life-history parameters (coprophily, parasitism, breeding in ephemeral plant parts, malacophagy and adult feeding habits – especially haematophagy) are analysed critically, as are potential advantages (shorter larval life, less investment in yolk by mother, protection of vulnerable stages, better access to breeding substrates, predation on competitors). Morphological constraints, adaptations and exaptations are reviewed, including the provision of an incubation space for the egg(s), the positioning of the egg(s) in the uterus, and maternal glands. The main morphological adaptations include greater egg size, reduction of egg respiratory filaments, thinning of chorion, modified larval respiratory system and mouthparts, and instar skipping. Female morphology and behaviour is particularly strongly modified for viviparity. The terminalia are shortened, the vagina is more muscular and tracheated, and the ovaries of unilarviparous species have a reduced number of ovarioles with alternate ovulation. Many of the final conclusions are tentative, and a plea is made for more detailed morphological and experimental study of many of the viviparous species. Viviparity in Diptera provides a fascinating example of multiple parallel evolution, and a fertile field for future research.},

abstract = {Human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) and animal African trypanosomiasis (AAT) are significant health concerns throughout much of sub-Saharan Africa. Funding for tsetse fly control operations has decreased since the 1970s, which has in turn limited the success of campaigns to control the disease vector. To maximize the effectiveness of the limited financial resources available for tsetse control, this study develops and analyzes spatially and temporally dynamic tsetse distribution maps of Glossina subgenus Morsitans populations in Kenya from January 2002 to December 2010, produced using the Tsetse Ecological Distribution Model. These species distribution maps reveal seasonal variations in fly distributions. Such variations allow for the identification of "control reservoirs" where fly distributions are spatially constrained by fluctuations in suitable habitat and tsetse population characteristics. Following identification of the control reservoirs, a tsetse management operation is simulated in the control reservoirs using capital and labor control inputs from previous studies. Finally, a cost analysis, following specific economic guidelines from existing tsetse control analyses, is conducted to calculate the total cost of a nationwide control campaign of the reservoirs compared to the cost of a nationwide campaign conducted at the maximum spatial extent of the fly distributions from January 2002 to December 2010. The total cost of tsetse management within the reservoirs sums to {\$}14,212,647, while the nationwide campaign at the maximum spatial extent amounts to {\$}33,721,516. This savings of {\$}19,508,869 represents the importance of identifying seasonally dynamic control reservoirs when conducting a tsetse management campaign, and, in the process, offers an economical means of fly control and disease management for future program planning. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {There has been much debate as to whether or not climate change will have, or has had, any significant effect on risk from vector-borne diseases. The debate on the former has focused on the degree to which occurrence and levels of risk of vector-borne diseases are determined by climate-dependent or independent factors, while the debate on the latter has focused on whether changes in disease incidence are due to climate at all, and/or are attributable to recent climate change. Here I review possible effects of climate change on vector-borne diseases, methods used to predict these effects and the evidence to date of changes in vector-borne disease risks that can be attributed to recent climate change. Predictions have both over- and underestimated the effects of climate change. Mostly under-estimations of effects are due to a focus only on direct effects of climate on disease ecology while more distal effects on society's capacity to control and prevent vector-borne disease are ignored. There is increasing evidence for possible impacts of recent climate change on some vector-borne diseases but for the most part, observed data series are too short (or non-existent), and impacts of climate-independent factors too great, to confidently attribute changing risk to climate change.},

abstract = {Emerging vector-borne diseases are an important issue in global health. Many vector-borne pathogens have appeared in new regions in the past two decades, while many endemic diseases have increased in incidence. Although introductions and emergence of endemic pathogens are often considered to be distinct processes, many endemic pathogens are actually spreading at a local scale coincident with habitat change. We draw attention to key differences between dynamics and disease burden that result from increased pathogen transmission after habitat change and after introduction into new regions. Local emergence is commonly driven by changes in human factors as much as by enhanced enzootic cycles, whereas pathogen invasion results from anthropogenic trade and travel where and when conditions (eg, hosts, vectors, and climate) are suitable for a pathogen. Once a pathogen is established, ecological factors related to vector characteristics can shape the evolutionary selective pressure and result in increased use of people as transmission hosts. We describe challenges inherent in the control of vector-borne zoonotic diseases and some emerging non-traditional strategies that could be effective in the long term.},

The 4-methyl-substituted derivative (2-methoxy-4-methylphenol) was found to elicit stronger repellent responses from the flies compared with guaiacol. None of the other analogues showed significant repellent effects on flies. 4-Methylguaiacol, guaiacol, and eugenol (which was included because of previous reports of its repellency against a number of arthropods) were further evaluated in the field with wild populations of predominantly Glossina pallidipes Austen. The presence of guaiacol or eugenol near odor-baited traps caused some nonsignificant reduction in the number of tsetse catches at relatively high release rates (approximately 50 mg/hr). In contrast, the 4-methyl derivative at three different release rates (2.2, 4.5, and 9.0 mg/hr) reduced trap catches of baited traps in a dose-response manner. At 10 mg/hr release rate, it reduced the catches of baited and unbaited traps by approximately 80 and approximately 70{\%}, respectively. In addition, the compound not only reduced the number of tsetse attracted to natural ox odor (approximately 80{\%}), but also had an effect on their feeding responses, reducing the proportion that fed on an ox by more than 80{\%}. Our study shows that the presence of a methyl substituent at the 4-position of guaiacol enhances the repellency of the molecule to savannah tsetse and suggests that 4-methylguaiacol may represent a promising additional tool in the arsenal of techniques in trypanosomiasis control.},

abstract = {The insect hemoflagellate Crithidia luciliae thermophila can be maintained in culture within a range of temperatures from 15 to 37 C. In an attempt to determine the biochemical basis of its unusual thermal tolerance, we measured the specific activities of active oxygen-scavenging enzymes in C. luciliae thermophila maintained at 25 C and at 37 C. Hyperthermia is associated with an 82{\%} increase in the specific activity of superoxide dismutase without a qualitative change in the spectrum of isoenzymes, a 54{\%} decrease in catalase, and a 34{\%} increase in NADPH-dependent hydrogen peroxide consumption. Our results suggest that the superoxide dismutase present in C. luciliae thermophila is an iron-containing superoxide dismutase and that increased superoxide-scavenging ability accounts in part for survival at elevated temperatures. In the related trypanosomes and leishmanias, active oxygen scavenging contributes to the capacity to withstand oxidant-mediated phagocyte killing and resistance to some anti-parasitic drugs. The thermotolerance of C. luciliae thermophila recommends it as a model for investigating heat-induced gene expression in relation to parasite survival.},

abstract = {In the 1960s, it appeared that human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) could be effectively controlled, but by the beginning of the twenty-first century several decades of neglect had led to alarming numbers of reported new cases, with an estimated 300 000 people infected. The World Health Organization (WHO) responded with a series of initiatives aimed at bringing HAT under control again. Since 2001, the pharmaceutical companies that produce drugs for HAT have committed themselves to providing them free of charge to WHO for distribution for the treatment of patients. In addition, funds have been provided to WHO to support national sleeping sickness control programmes to boost control and surveillance of the disease. That, coupled with bilateral cooperation and the work of nongovernmental organizations, helped reverse the upward trend in HAT prevalence. By 2012, the number of reported cases was fewer than 8000. This success in bringing HAT under control led to its inclusion in the WHO Roadmap for eradication, elimination and control of neglected tropical diseases, with a target set to eliminate the disease as a public health problem by 2020. A further target has been set, by countries in which HAT is endemic, to eliminate gambiense HAT by reducing the incidence of infection to zero in a defined geographical area. This report provides information about new diagnostic approaches, new therapeutic regimens and better understanding of the distribution of the disease with high-quality mapping. The roles of human and animal reservoirs and the tsetse fly vectors that transmit the parasites are emphasized. The new information has formed the basis for an integrated strategy with which it is hoped that elimination of gambiense HAT will be achieved. The report also contains recommendations on the approaches that will lead to elimination of the disease.},

Catches were not affected when traps were baited with phenols alone at evaporation rates of 0.38 mg/h (4-methylphenol) and 0.022 mg/h (3-n-propylphenol). Catches of Hybomitra horseflies were increased by 1.5-1.9 times with cow urine and 2.6 times with cow urine + octenol. This bait combination could prove to be particularly useful for Hybomitra horseflies, the common tabanids of northern environments.},

abstract = {The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) call for an integrated response, the kind that has defined Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) efforts in the past decade.NTD interventions have the greatest relevance for SDG3, the health goal, where the focus on equity, and its commitment to reaching people in need of health services, wherever they may live and whatever their circumstances, is fundamentally aligned with the target of Universal Health Coverage. NTD interventions, however, also affect and are affected by many of the other development areas covered under the 2030 Agenda. Strategies such as mass drug administration or the programmatic integration of NTD and WASH activities (SDG6) are driven by effective global partnerships (SDG17). Intervention against the NTDs can also have an impact on poverty (SDG1) and hunger (SDG2), can improve education (SDG4), work and economic growth (SDG8), thereby reducing inequalities (SDG10). The community-led distribution of donated medicines to more than 1 billion people reinforces women's empowerment (SDG5), logistics infrastructure (SDG9) and non-discrimination against disability (SDG16). Interventions to curb mosquito-borne NTDs contribute to the goals of urban sustainability (SDG11) and resilience to climate change (SDG13), while the safe use of insecticides supports the goal of sustainable ecosystems (SDG15). Although indirectly, interventions to control water- and animal-related NTDs can facilitate the goals of small-scale fishing (SDG14) and sustainable hydroelectricity and biofuels (SDG7).NTDs proliferate in less developed areas in countries across the income spectrum, areas where large numbers of people have little or no access to adequate health care, clean water, sanitation, housing, education, transport and information. This scoping review assesses how in this context, ending the epidemic of the NTDs can impact and improve our prospects of attaining the SDGs.},

abstract = {This study aims to assess trends in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) incidence in South Africa, and to assess the extent to which prevention and treatment programmes have reduced HIV incidence. Two models of the South African HIV epidemic, the STI (sexually transmitted infection)-HIV Interaction model and the ASSA2003 AIDS and Demographic model, were adapted. Both models were fitted to age-specific HIV prevalence data from antenatal clinic surveys and household surveys, using a Bayesian approach. Both models suggest that HIV incidence in 15-49 year olds declined significantly between the start of 2000 and the start of 2008: by 27 per cent (95{\%} CI: 21-32{\%}) in the STI-HIV model and by 31 per cent (95{\%} CI: 23-39{\%}) in the ASSA2003 model, when expressed as a percentage of incidence rates in 2000. By 2008, the percentage reduction in incidence owing to increased condom use was 37 per cent (95{\%} CI: 34-41{\%}) in the STI-HIV model and 23 per cent (95{\%} CI: 14-34{\%}) in the ASSA2003 model. Both models also estimated a small reduction in incidence owing to antiretroviral treatment by 2008. Increased condom use therefore appears to be the most significant factor explaining the recent South African HIV incidence decline.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Accurate and reliable laboratory methods are needed for estimation of HIV-1 incidence to identify the high-risk populations and target and monitor prevention efforts. We previously described a single-well limiting-antigen avidity enzyme immunoassay (LAg-Avidity EIA) to detect recent HIV-1 infection.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: We describe here further optimization and characterization of LAg-Avidity EIA, comparing it to the BED assay and a two-well avidity-index (AI) EIA. Specimen sets included longitudinal sera (n = 393), collected from 89 seroconverting individuals from 4 cohorts representing 4 HIV-1 subtypes, and sera from AIDS patients (n = 488) with or without TB co-infections from 3 different cohorts. Ninety seven HIV-1 positive specimens were purchased commercially. The BED assay, LAg-Avidity EIA, AI-EIA and HIV serology were performed, as needed.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Monitoring quality control specimens indicated high reproducibility of the LAg-Avidity EIA with coefficient of variation of {\textless}10{\%} in the dynamic range. The LAg-Avidity EIA has an overall mean duration of recency ($\omega$) of 141 days (95{\%} CI 119-160) at normalized optical density (ODn) cutoff of 1.0, with similar $\omega$ in different HIV-1 subtypes and populations (132 to 143 days). Antibody avidity kinetics were similar among individuals and subtypes by both the LAg-Avidity EIA and AI-EIA compared to the HIV-IgG levels measured by the BED assay. The false recent rate among individuals with AIDS was 0.2{\%} with the LAg-Avidity EIA, compared to 2.9{\%} with the BED assay. Western blot profiles of specimens with increasing avidity confirm accurate detection of recent HIV-1 infections.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate that the LAg-Avidity EIA is a promising assay with consistent $\omega$ in different populations and subtypes. The assay should be very useful for 1) estimating HIV-1 incidence in cross-sectional specimens as part of HIV surveillance, 2) identifying risk factors for recent infections, 3) measuring impact of prevention programs, and 4) studying avidity maturation during vaccine trials.},

If the age structure is fairly constant, R = exp(- betag). Extensions of the model correcting for feeding patterns are given. A simple method is applied to an example of Anopheles gambiae Giles biting density and parity ratio in Cĵte d'Ivoire (fortnightly sampled longitudinal data set), for calculation of the seasonally fluctuating mortality rate, correcting for effects of recruitment. The seasonal variations in birth rate and mortality rate are discussed in relation to variations in density and rainfall.},

The history of HIV prevention research is dominated by failed approaches, but recent developments have provided reason for hope. These include the successful male circumcision outcomes in trials in South Africa, Kenya and Uganda, the recent protective outcome of a tenofovir vaginal gel trial in South Africa and the proof that pre-exposure prophylaxis with oral combination tenofovir/emtricitabine can work in men. The latter positive outcome has however been shattered by the early closure of FEM-PrEP for futility. The challenge now is on how to best integrate emerging prevention methods with established strategies, recognising that some of the older methods have never been scaled up to saturation level.},

Targets were initially deployed in the three habitat types (grassland, woodland and forest) of two adjacent areas at a density of four targets per km(2). One area functioned as the treatment block (c. 35 km(2)) and included the focus of the target deployment, and the second area functioned as a barrier block (c. 40 km(2)) against tsetse fly re-invasion from the untreated area to the south. After 8 months, targets were removed from open grassland in both areas and target density in wooded habitats and sand forest was increased to eight per km(2). Twelve months later, all targets were removed from the barrier block and used to increase target density in the wooded and sand forest habitats of the treatment block to 12 per km(2). This target density was maintained for 14 months. In the treatment area, a 99{\%} reduction in G. austeni females occurred after 13 months at a target density of eight per km(2) in wooded habitat; this was maintained for 22 months. Reduction in G. brevipalpis was less marked. The relatively poor reduction in G. brevipalpis is attributed to the high mobility of this species and its distribution throughout less wooded and more open habitats.},

abstract = {The tremendous variation in the life-history patterns of organisms is best explained as adaptive. Any organism has a limited amount of re- sources at its disposal, and these have to be partitioned between reproductive and nonreproductive activities. A larger share of resources to reproductive activities, that is, a higher reproductive effort at any age, leads to a better reproductive performance at that age; this may be con- sidered as a profit function. This reproductive effort also leads to a reduce tion in survival and growth and consequent diminution of the reproductive contribution of the succeeding stages in the life history; this may be con- sidered as a cost function. Natural selection would tend to an adjustment of the reproductive effort at every age such that the overall fitness of the life history would be maximized. A model of life history processes has been developed on the basis of these considerations. It leads to the following predictions: 1. If the form of the profit function is convex, or that of the cost func- tion concave, the optimal strategy may be to breed repeatedly. Other- wise, the optimal strategy is to breed only once in a suicidal effort like a salmon (big-bang reproduction). 2. The value of reproductive effort continuously increases with age in the case of repeated reproducers. 3. If all the stages in the life history following a certain age are ad- versely affected, the age of reproduction will tend to be lowered in the case of big-bang reproducers, and the reproductive effort at all ages preceding that stage will tend to increase in the case of repeated reproducers. 4. As the reproductive potential increases with size at a slower rate, reproductive effort will be lower at maturity, reproductive effort will increase at a higher rate with age, and growth will continue beyond maturity. 5. A uniform change in the probability of survival from one age to the next at all ages would have no effect by itself, on the age of reproduc- tion in big-bang breeders or on the distribution of reproductive effort with age in the repeated reproducers. 6. Such a change in survivorship would lead to a change in the equilib- rium density of a population. If the population is resource limited, this would affect the availability of resources to the members of the population in such a way that an increase in mortality would increase the availability of the resources. 7. For a resource-limited organism a greater availability of resources would lead to a lowering of the age of reproduction in the case of the big-bang breeders, and to a greater reproductive effort at all ages for the repeated breeders.},

abstract = {  Samples of Glossina longipennis Corti, taken over four days in traps (baited with acetone, cow urine and octenol) at half-hourly intervals during their restricted activity periods at dusk and dawn, were analysed for their nutritional condition. For both sexes, trap catches were highest at the end of dusk, between 19.00 and 19.30 h, associated with a significant increase in numbers with the low haematin content characteristic of flies estimated to have fed more than 60 hours previously. Also, the mean fat content of these flies was significantly lower than that of those trapped earlier. There was considerable day-to-day variation in the numbers of flies trapped, and in the numbers of low haematin and low fat flies. It is concluded that the nutritional condition of the fly probably influences the timing of the onset of activity, but possibly the fly's approach to the trap.},

abstract = {Tsetse flies are vectors of human and animal trypanosomoses in sub-Saharan Africa and are the target of the Pan African Tsetse and Trypanosomiasis Eradication Campaign (PATTEC). Glossina palpalis gambiensis (Diptera: Glossinidae) is a riverine species that is still present as an isolated metapopulation in the Niayes area of Senegal. It is targeted by a national eradication campaign combining a population reduction phase based on insecticide-treated targets (ITTs) and cattle and an eradication phase based on the sterile insect technique. In this study, we used species distribution models to optimize control operations. We compared the probability of the presence of G. p. gambiensis and habitat suitability using a regularized logistic regression and Maxent, respectively. Both models performed well, with an area under the curve of 0.89 and 0.92, respectively. Only the Maxent model predicted an expert-based classification of landscapes correctly. Maxent predictions were therefore used throughout the eradication campaign in the Niayes to make control operations more efficient in terms of deployment of ITTs, release density of sterile males, and location of monitoring traps used to assess program progress. We discuss how the models' results informed about the particular ecology of tsetse in the target area. Maxent predictions allowed optimizing efficiency and cost within our project, and might be useful for other tsetse control campaigns in the framework of the PATTEC and, more generally, other vector or insect pest control programs.},

abstract = {Phenotypic plasticity allows organisms to cope with environmental variation and may aid in the evolution of novel traits. However, whether phenotypic plasticity is beneficial, or if acclimation responses might be constrained to particular ecotypes is generally poorly explored. Here we test the beneficial acclimation hypothesis (BAH) and its alternatives for desiccation resistance to atmospheric moisture in mesic- and xeric-adapted Glossina species. Highly significant interactions among acclimation and test humidity were detected for water loss rates indicative of significant phenotypic plasticity. Ordered-factor anova was unable to reject predictions of the 'drier is better' acclimation hypothesis in xeric Glossina morsitans and mesic G. austeni. Evidence for the 'deleterious acclimation hypothesis' was found for mesic G. palpalis as expected from the moist habitats it typically occupies. By contrast, support for the 'optimal acclimation hypothesis' was found in xeric G. pallidipes. Little support for BAH was obtained in the present study, although other hypotheses, which might enhance fitness within the environments these species are typically exposed to, were supported. However, acclimation responses were not necessarily constrained to xeric/mesic ecotypes which might be expected if adaptation to a particular environment arose as a trade-off between plastic responses and living in a particular habitat. These results highlight the complexity of acclimation responses and suggest an important role for phenotypic plasticity in moderating environmental effects on evolutionary fitness in Glossina.},

@article{Mangal2008,
abstract = {Background. Many parasites of medical and veterinary importance are transmitted by cold-blooded intermediate hosts or vectors, the abundance of which will vary with ambient temperatures, potentially altering disease prevalence. In particular, if global climate change will increase mean ambient temperature in a region endemic with a human pathogen then it is possible that the incidence of disease will similarly increase. Here we examine this possibility by using a mathematical model to explore the effects of increasing long-term mean ambient temperature on the prevalence and abundance of the parasite Schistosoma mansoni, the causative agent of schistosomiasis in humans. Principal Findings. The model showed that the impact of temperature on disease prevalence and abundance is not straightforward; the mean infection burden in humans increases up to 30 degrees C, but then crashes at 35 degrees C, primarily due to increased mortalities of the snail intermediate host. In addition, increased temperatures changed the dynamics of disease from stable, endemic infection to unstable, epidemic cycles at 35 degrees C. However, the prevalence of infection was largely unchanged by increasing temperatures. Temperature increases also affected the response of the model to changes in each parameter, indicating certain control strategies may become less effective with local temperature changes. At lower temperatures, the most effective single control strategy is to target the adult parasites through chemotherapy. However, as temperatures increase, targeting the snail intermediate hosts, for example through molluscicide use, becomes more effective. Conclusions. These results show that S. mansoni will not respond to increased temperatures in a linear fashion, and the optimal control strategy is likely to change as temperatures change. It is only through a mechanistic approach, incorporating the combined effects of temperature on all stages of the life-cycle, that we can begin to predict the consequences of climate change on the incidence and severity of such diseases.},

abstract = {In an on-farm trial conducted amongst the Maasai pastoralists in Nkuruman and Nkineji areas of Kenya between April 2004 and August 2005 designed to evaluate the effectiveness of a synthetic tsetse repellent technology, we assessed the relationship between tsetse challenge and trypanosomosis incidence in cattle. Six villages were used in each area. Each of these villages had a sentinel cattle herd that was screened for trypanosomosis on monthly basis using buffy coat technique. Animals found infected at each sampling were treated with diminazene aceturate at 7 mg kg-1 body weight. Treatments administered by the owners over the sampling intervals were recorded as well. Tsetse flies were trapped at the time of sampling using baited stationary traps and apparent tsetse density estimated as flies per trap per day (FTD). A fixed proportion (10{\%}) of the flies was dissected and their infection status determined through microscopy. Blood meals were also collected from some of the flies and their sources identified using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Tsetse challenge was obtained as a product of tsetse density, trypanosome prevalence and the proportion of blood meals obtained from cattle. This variable was transformed using logarithmic function and fitted as an independent factor in a Poisson model that had trypanosomosis incidence in the sentinel cattle as the outcome of interest. The mean trypanosomosis incidence in the sentinel group of cattle was 7.2 and 10.2{\%} in Nkuruman and Nkineji, respectively. Glossina pallidipes was the most prevalent tsetse species in Nkuruman while G. swynnertoni was prevalent in Nkineji. The proportions of tsetse that had mature infections in the respective areas were 0.6 and 4.2{\%}. Most tsetse (28{\%}) sampled in Nkuruman had blood meals from warthogs while most of those sampled in Nkineji (30{\%}) had blood meals from cattle. A statistically significant association between tsetse challenge and trypanosomosis incidence was obtained only in Nkuruman when data was pooled and analyzed at the area but not at the village-level. In the later scenario, lagging tsetse challenge by 1 month improved the strength but not the significance of the association. These findings show that when the spatial unit of analysis in observational studies or on-farm trials is small, for instance a village, it may not be possible to demonstrate a statistically significant association between tsetse challenge and trypanosomosis incidence in livestock so as to effectively control for tsetse challenge. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Here we highlight how quantile regression overcomes some of the confounding effects of large climate variability in long-term rainfall data. For instance, we show how quantile regressions revealed that droughts worsened in Hwange National Park (Zimbabwe) during the course of the 20th century, a change that would not have been detected using simple linear regression.

These models are the workhorse for much economic theorizing about ageing, but traditionally have used simplistic assumptions about mortality, in particular that human death rates are independent of age. Li and Tuljapurkar show that mortality patterns can usefully be discussed in terms of the distribution of age at death and that this distribution is approximately normal in modern humans. They then find and discuss the optimal steady states of three models: a simple model with neither education nor retirement, a model with endogenous schooling and no retirement and, finally, a model with endogenous schooling and an exogenous retirement. They show that both the average age at death, and its variance, matter to the equilibrium properties of the models and that age-independent mortality is a poor approximation. They show that the optimal years of schooling decrease as the exogenous age of retirement increases. This analysis is a fundamental first step in the development of realistic demographic-economic models.},

abstract = {A neural mechanism coordinates pupariation behavior and tanning in the tsetse larva. At parturition, the mature larva has already received sufficient ecdysteroid to commit the epidermal cells to metamorphosis but, before sclerotization and tanning of the cuticle can begin, the larva must first select a pupariation site and then proceed through a stereotypic sequence of pupariation behavior that culminates in the formation of a smooth, ovoid puparium. Both pupariation behavior and tanning are inhibited by the central nervous system (CNS) during the wandering phase. This central inhibition is maintained by sensory input originating in the extreme posterior region of the body. At the transition from wandering to pupariation, the posterior signal that induces inhibition of pupariation behavior is removed and the larva begins the contractions associated with pupariation, but the CNS inhibition of tanning persists. At this point, separation of the body into two halves by ligation or nerve transection prevents tanning of the anterior half (containing the CNS), whereas the denervated integument of the posterior half tans completely. Transection of nerves to the midline of the body produces larvae with a tanning pattern that ends abruptly along a sagittal plane, implying that the central control of this process is uncoupled between the left and right regions of the CNS. A few minutes later, when the final shape of the puparium is completed, the CNS inhibition is lifted and the tanning process begins. At this time, separation of the body into two halves by ligation or nerve transection has no inhibitory effects on either part. Exogenous ecdysteroids fail to release the CNS inhibition, and hemolymph containing the pupariation factors from Sarcophaga bullata have no accelerating effects on tsetse pupariation. These results imply that regulation of metamorphosis in the insect integument is not the exclusive domain of blood-borne hormones.},

abstract = {Risk-sensitive foraging may occur whenever feeding success has non-linear effects on fitness. Models of sensitivity to variation in amount of food obtained have concentrated on foraging in order to survive even though feeding during growth, migration, or reproduction can have strong and non-linear effects on fitness. I illustrate how risk-sensitive foraging for reproduction could differ from risk-sensitive foraging for survival using two simple models. Each model assumes that organisms must accumulate some threshold amount of resources before they can reproduce. In the first model, additional resources above the threshold lead to increased reproductive success. Here variance in feeding success can be advantageous even when the mean gain would allow organisms to reproduce. In the second model, early breeding is superior to late breeding because recruitment rate declines over time. Here a symmetrical distribution in foraging rates results in a skewed distribution of breeding times. Despite this, variance in feeding success may be advantageous even when the seasonal decline in recruitment is linear. The advantage of risk is much larger if foragers can switch freely between feeding options. These two models are united by “the bankruptcy effect” because all failures to reproduce carry the same consequences. These simple models suggest that risk-prone foraging may be likely when factors other than survival are important for fitness. Finally, I advocate using a mix of modelling techniques, note the implicitly risk-sensitive nature of stochastic dynamic programming, and speculate on potential connections between risk-sensitive foraging and theories of life histories in variable environments.

abstract = {The distribution and abundance of Glossina austeni Newstead and Glossina brevipalpis Newstead (Diptera: Glossinidae) were studied in the three main vegetation types in Zululand, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. During a period of 12 months, a trap transect consisting of 38 H-traps traversing the three vegetation types was monitored. The Index of Apparent Abundance (IAA) for G. brevipalpis was high in indigenous forest and open grassland but lower in exotic plantations. Glossina austeni, on the other hand, was captured mainly in or adjacent to indigenous forest. The seasonal trend in the IAA did not differ between vegetation types. The findings on the distribution of G. brevipalpis are in contrast with the historic records. Historically, this species was considered to be restricted to areas with a dense overhead canopy and high relative humidity. The repercussions of these findings for the epidemiology of livestock trypanosomiasis and the control of tsetse in Zululand are discussed},

abstract = {Tsetse flies Glossina pallidipes Austen and G. morsitans morsitans Westwood deposit their larvae in warthog burrows, in August-November, at Rekomitjie Research Station, Zambezi Valley, Zimbabwe. Artificial burrows, made from 200-l steel drums, were used to sample these flies and to collect their puparia. Sand-filled plastic trays in the burrows served as a substrate for larval deposition. The sand was covered with c. 2 cm of leaf litter after it was shown that only 3{\%} of larvae were deposited on bare sand if both substrates were available. Other burrow modifications - artificially shading the burrow entrance, increasing the relative humidity inside the burrow, or reducing the size of the burrow entrance - significantly decreased deposition rates. The use of burrows in the hot season results in a reduction in the temperature experienced by the puparium towards an assumed optimum level of 26 degrees C. Artificial burrows maintained a mean temperature of 28.5 degrees C during October-November 1998, c. 2.5 degrees C cooler than ambient; earlier work has shown that natural burrows can be c. 5 degrees C cooler than ambient at these times. This may explain why natural burrows in full sunlight were used for larviposition, whereas artificial burrows were used only when they were in deep shade, and why significantly higher proportions of G. pallidipes were found in natural (66{\%}) than in artificial burrows (34{\%}). Better-insulated artificial burrows might produce more puparia with higher proportions of G. pallidipes. Burrows become waterlogged during the rains and may be too cool for optimum puparial development during the rest of the year. The percentages of G. m. morsitans in catches of females from artificial burrows, refuges and odour-baited traps were 34, 26 and {\textless} 10{\%} respectively. Traps are biased in favour of G. pallidipes; artificial burrows may show a bias in favour of G. m. morsitans that is a function of temperature. Artificial warthog burrows provide a convenient way of studying the puparial stage in tsetse and for the first time facilitate the capture of females as they deposit their larvae.},

abstract = {As a category A agent in the Center for Disease Control bioterrorism list, Rift Valley fever (RVF) is considered a major threat to the United States (USA). Should the pathogen be intentionally or unintentionally introduced to the continental USA, there is tremendous potential for economic damages due to loss of livestock, trade restrictions, and subsequent food supply chain disruptions. We have incorporated the effects of space into a mathematical model of RVF in order to study the dynamics of the pathogen spread as affected by the movement of humans, livestock, and mosquitoes. The model accounts for the horizontal transmission of Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) between two mosquito and one livestock species, and mother-to-offspring transmission of virus in one of the mosquito species. Space effects are introduced by dividing geographic space into smaller patches and considering the patch-to-patch movement of species. For each patch, a system of ordinary differential equations models fractions of populations susceptible to, incubating, infectious with, or immune to RVFV. The main contribution of this work is a methodology for analyzing the likelihood of pathogen establishment should an introduction occur into an area devoid of RVF. Examples are provided for general and specific cases to illustrate the methodology.},

abstract = {Mosquito-borne diseases cause significant public health burden, mostly in tropical and sub-tropical regions, and are widely emerging or re-emerging in areas where previously absent. Understanding, predicting, and mitigating the spread of mosquito-borne disease in diverse populations and geographies are ongoing modeling challenges. We propose a hybrid network-patch model for the spread of mosquito-borne pathogens that accounts for the movement of individuals through mosquito habitats and responds to environmental factors such as rainfall and temperature. Our approach extends the capabilities of existing agent-based models for individual movement developed to predict the spread of directly transmitted pathogens in populations. To extend to mosquito-borne disease, agent-based models are coupled with differential equations representing `clouds' of mosquitoes in geographic patches that account for mosquito ecology, including heterogeneity in mosquito density, emergence rates, and extrinsic incubation period. We illustrate the method by adapting an agent-based model for human movement across a network to mosquito-borne disease. We investigated the importance of heterogeneity in mosquito population dynamics and host movement on pathogen transmission, motivating the utility of detailed models of individual behavior. We observed that the total number of infected people is greater in heterogeneous patch models with one high risk patch and high or medium human movement than it would be in a random mixing homogeneous model. Our hybrid agent-based/differential equation model is able to quantify the importance of the heterogeneity in predicting the spread and invasion of mosquito-borne pathogens. Mitigation strategies can be more effective when guided by realistic models created by extending the capabilities of existing agent-based models to include vector-borne diseases.},

RAE B 54 200; 55 46], in which dawn-to-dusk catches of wild flies were made on tethered bait oxen in the Lugala area, on the north-eastern shore of Lake Victoria in Uganda. The following is virtually the author's summary. Between June 1964 and May 1965, samples of G. pallidipes A ust., G. fuscipes Newst. (G. palpalis fuscipes) and G. brevipalpis Newst. were caught. Both males and females were classified into age-categories according to the degree of wear of the wings. Females were also classified into ovarian age-categories according to the exact or approximate number of ovulations that had taken place. All were examined for presence of infections with Trypanosoma, which were classified as vivax-type, congolense-type or brucei-type according to their position in the flies. The percentage compositions of the samples by wing-fray category are compared. The mean wing-fray category of females of G. fuscipes and G. brevipalpis was somewhat lower, and that of females of G. pallidipes somewhat higher, than that of the corresponding males. However, the figures for infection rate in females of all three species were higher than in the corresponding males, significantly so in G. pallidipes and G. fuscipes, and it seems probable that the mean age of females, at least of the two latter species, was greater than that of males. Among females, the range of calendar ages of flies in the various fray categories was wide. The modified method of determining physiological age [55 333, etc.] in which females more than about 42 days old are classified into four age-categories does not extend far enough to give a reasonable pattern for the age-composition of any of the species at Lugala, and many of the individuals caught must have been more than about 80 days old. Seasonal fluctuations in mean wing-fray and in the proportion of old flies in the population were correlated with changes in infection rate of females of G. fuscipes but not of those of G. pallidipes. Among males of neither of these species were seasonal fluctuations in mean fray correlated with changes in infection rate, though among those of G. fuscipes the two varied similarly between June and February. Females of G. pallidipes and G. fuscipes about 31-42 days old had significantly fewer brucei-type infections than those over 42 days old, and either the developmental cycle in the field must normally be longer than that recorded in laboratory investigations or many of the flies must become infected when more than just a few days old.},

abstract = {Tsetse flies are notoriously difficult to observe in nature, particularly when populations densities are low. It is therefore difficult to observe them on their hosts in nature; hence their vertebrate species can very often only be determined indirectly by analysis of their gut contents. This knowledge is a critical component of the information on which control tactics can be developed. The objective of this study was to determine the sources of tsetse bloodmeals, hence investigate their feeding preferences. We used mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase 1 (COI) and cytochrome b (cytb) gene sequences for identification of tsetse fly blood meals, in order to provide a foundation for rational decisions to guide control of trypanosomiasis, and their vectors. Glossina swynnertoni were sampled from Serengeti (Tanzania) and G. pallidipes from Kenya (Nguruman and Busia), and Uganda. Sequences were used to query public databases, and the percentage identities obtained used to identify hosts. An initial assay showed that the feeds were from single sources. Hosts identified from blood fed flies collected in Serengeti ecosystem, included buffaloes (25/40), giraffes (8/40), warthogs (3/40), elephants (3/40) and one spotted hyena. In Nguruman, where G. pallidipes flies were analyzed, the feeds were from elephants (6/13) and warthogs (5/13), while buffaloes and baboons accounted for one bloodmeal each. Only cattle blood was detected in flies caught in Busia and Uganda. Out of four flies tested in Mbita Point, Suba District in western Kenya, one had fed on cattle, the other three on the Nile monitor lizard. These results demonstrate that cattle will form an integral part of a control strategy for trypanosomiasis in Busia and Uganda, while different approaches are required for Serengeti and Nguruman ecosystems, where wildlife abound and are the major component of the tsetse fly food source.},

The lengths (l2 and lu) of the second largest oocyte and of the larva in utero were found to increase approximately exponentially during pregnancy. The length (l1) of the largest oocyte increased exponentially for about the first 80{\%} of pregnancy. Linear relationships between the log values of l1, l2 and lu in field-caught flies, of unknown chronological age, are consistent with the idea that growth patterns are similar in laboratory, island and open field situations. The egg phase takes up c. 45{\%} of pregnancy in both species, regardless of season and the absolute duration of pregnancy. The changes in the log values of l1, l2 and lu, over the ranges within which they change linearly, can be used to assign flies to their stage of pregnancy. When applied to field data the rule showed that G. pallidipes caught in odour-baited traps, and on a mobile electric net, exhibited major activity peaks shortly before and after parturition. Flies from the trap (but not the net) showed a smaller peak of activity near the middle of pregnancy. The egg and the three larval phases in utero take up c. 45{\%}, 25{\%}, 20{\%} and 10{\%} of pregnancy respectively},

Glossina spp.). HAT is usually fatal if untreated and transmission occurs in foci across sub-Saharan Africa. Mathematical modelling of HAT began in the 1980s with extensions of the Ross-Macdonald malaria model and has since consisted, with a few exceptions, of similar deterministic compartmental models. These models have captured the main features of HAT epidemiology and provided insight on the effectiveness of the two main control interventions (treatment of humans and tsetse fly control) in eliminating transmission. However, most existing models have overestimated prevalence of infection and ignored transient dynamics. There is a need for properly validated models, evolving with improved data collection, that can provide quantitative predictions to help guide control and elimination strategies for HAT.},

abstract = {Copyright {\textcopyright} Cambridge University Press 2015. Mortality estimates are central to understanding tsetse fly population dynamics, but are difficult to acquire from wild populations. They can be obtained from age distribution data but, with limited data, it is unclear whether the assumptions required to make the estimates are satisfied and, if not, how violations affect the estimates. We evaluate the assumptions required for existing mortality estimation techniques using long-term longitudinal ovarian dissection data from 144,106 female tsetse, Glossina pallidipes Austen, captured in Zimbabwe between 1988 and 1999. At the end of the hot-dry season each year, mean ovarian ages peaked, and maximum-likelihood mortality estimates declined to low levels, contrary to mark-recapture estimates, suggesting violations of the assumptions underlying the estimation technique. We demonstrate that age distributions are seldom stable for G. pallidipes at our study site, and hypothesize that this is a consequence of a disproportionate increase in the mortality of pupae and young adults at the hottest times of the year. Assumptions of age-independent mortality and capture probability are also violated, the latter bias varying with capture method and with pregnancy and nutritional status. As a consequence, mortality estimates obtained from ovarian dissection data are unreliable. To overcome these problems we suggest simulating female tsetse populations, using dynamical modelling techniques that make no assumptions about the stability of the age distribution.},

Diagnosing imported HAT outside endemic areas is difficult and diagnosis is often delayed. We report a case of imported human African trypanosomiasis caused by Trypanosoma brucei gambiense with an unusually long incubation period of at least 7. years. A 33. year old male African patient, a former resident of Cameroon, presented with a 4-month history of progressive personality changes. A few weeks before presentation the patient had first been admitted to a psychiatric ward and received antidepressant treatment, until a lumbar puncture showed pleocytosis and then antibiotic treatment for suspected neuroborreliosis was initiated. The patient continued to deteriorate during antibiotic treatment and became increasingly lethargic. Under antiparasitic and anti-inflammatory treatment, the condition of the patient gradually improved over the following months and he recovered completely after 24. months of follow-up. This well-documented case illustrates typical difficulties in establishing the correct diagnosis outside endemic areas and provides an overview of typical clinical, neuropathological and neuroimaging findings in T. b. gambiense trypanosomiasis, guiding the clinician in establishing the correct diagnosis in this rare disease. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

abstract = {Background: Glossina fuscipes fuscipes is the primary vector of trypanosomiasis in humans and livestock in Uganda. The Lake Victoria basin has been targeted for tsetse eradication using a rolling carpet initiative, from west to east, with four operational blocks (3 in Uganda and 1 in Kenya), under a Pan-African Tsetse and Trypanosomiasis Eradication Campaign (PATTEC). We screened tsetse flies from the three Ugandan PATTEC blocks for genetic diversity at 15 microsatellite loci from continental and offshore populations to provide empirical data to support this initiative. Methods. We collected tsetse samples from 11 sites across the Lake Victoria basin in Uganda. We performed genetic analyses on 409 of the collected tsetse flies and added data collected for 278 individuals in a previous study. The flies were screened across 15 microsatellite loci and the resulting data were used to assess the temporal stability of populations, to analyze patterns of genetic exchange and structuring, to estimate dispersal rates and evaluate the sex bias in dispersal, as well as to estimate demographic parameters (NE and N C). Results: We found that tsetse populations in this region were stable over 4-16 generations and belong to 4 genetic clusters. Two genetic clusters (1 and 2) corresponded approximately to PATTEC blocks 1 and 2, while the other two (3 and 4) fell within PATTEC block 3. Island populations grouped into the same genetic clusters as neighboring mainland sites, suggesting presence of gene flow between these sites. There was no evidence of the stretch of water separating islands from the mainland forming a significant barrier to dispersal. Dispersal rates ranged from 2.5km per generation in cluster 1 to 14km per generation in clusters 3 and 4. We found evidence of male-biased dispersal. Few breeders are successfully dispersing over large distances. Effective population size estimates were low (33-310 individuals), while census size estimates ranged from 1200 (cluster 1) to 4100 (clusters 3 and 4). We present here a novel technique that adapts an existing census size estimation method to sampling without replacement, the scheme used in sampling tsetse flies. Conclusion: Our study suggests that different control strategies should be implemented for the three PATTEC blocks and that, given the high potential for re-invasion from island sites, mainland and offshore sites in each block should be targeted at the same time. {\textcopyright} 2012 Hyseni et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract = {Based on, previous studies of the trap-orientated behaviour of Diptera, a variety of new traps was designed to maximise the speed and probability of capturing Glossina morsitans morsitans Westw. and G. pallidipes Aust. arriving near traps, and to minimise the probability of capturing other flies. In Zimbabwe, catches were made with these traps in the presence and absence of carbon dioxide and acetone as odour attractants, leading to the identification of a simple trap for which the probability of capturing Glossina spp. was up to twice as great as it was for a standard biconical trap, and for which the probability of capturing other Diptera was very much less than it was for the biconical trap. The probability of capture by the simple trap was 100{\%} for G. pallidipes, 51{\%} for G. m. morsitans, 6{\%} for Stomoxyinae and 1{\%} for non-biting Muscidae. Half the tsetse that arrived near the simple trap were captured within 5 min of arrival. The number of tsetse that contacted simple targets designed to expose flies to insecticide amounted to 32-263{\%} of the catches of a biconical trap. The use of traps and targets for tsetse control, and the procedures for trap improvement, are discussed.},

abstract = {We conducted a field trial among Maasai cattle-keepers in Nkuruman and Nkineji areas of Kenya to evaluate the effectiveness of a synthetic tsetse-repellent technology developed for the control of trypanosomosis in cattle. The technology was a repellent (2-methoxy 4-methylphenol) emitted from dispensers attached to collars worn by cattle. Treatment was allocated at the herd level to ensure adequate protection of all the animals in a herd, with measurements of effectiveness conducted at the individual-animal level. The trial began in April 2005 and ran for 16 months including a baseline phase of 4 months. We recruited 12 herds in each area using a restricted random-sampling technique and distributed them equally into intervention (repellent) and control groups. Sample size was determined using a formal power calculation. Effectiveness or minimal worthwhile difference was defined as a 50{\%} reduction in the incidence of trypanosome infection in the treated versus control group (effectiveness below which the technology was considered by experts as not viable compared to existing control techniques). All the animals in the recruited herds were screened monthly (buffy-coat technique) for trypanosome infections. The analysis followed the principle of intention-to-treat by which subjects are analysed according to their initial treatment assignment, regardless of the mechanical performance of the device. Crude and adjusted effects of the technology were 23{\%} (p{\textless} 0.001) and 18{\%} (p= 0.08) reduction in the infection incidence in the treatment compared to the control groups, respectively. The impact of the technology estimated in this study did not achieve the threshold of 50{\%} reduction in the trypanosome infection incidence set a priori to indicate effectiveness (p{\textless} 0.001). We therefore concluded that the prototype repellent technology package was not sufficiently effective in reducing trypanosome infection incidence under natural tsetse challenge to merit commercial development. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {In Zimbabwe, high-resolution (10 Hz to an accuracy of ± 0.1 p.p.m.) measurements were made of atmospheric and host-produced CO2 in tsetse habitats during the dry season. The diel structure of atmospheric CO2 concentrations is bimodal, with a minimum at approximately 16.00 hours and maxima at approximately 05.00 hours and 20.00 hours, respectively. The background CO2 noise is greater in densely vegetated riverine woodland than in leafless, deciduous (mopane) woodland. Variation in atmospheric CO2 concentrations is correlated with decreasing wind speed and increasing thermal stability. Consequently, the background noise during the day is greatest in riverine woodland during early morning and late afternoon, when winds are typically light and stable, and thermal inversion conditions are developing. Measurements were made of CO2 at 8–64 m downwind from natural (two cattle) or synthetic sources (4–20 L min−1 CO2). The signal from the sources appears as fluctuations above threshold (approximately 355–362 p.p.m.), in the form of intermittent ‘bursts' of CO2. The strength, duration and intermittency of the signals attributable to these sources declines with source strength and distance from the source. In riverine woodland, approximately 50{\%} of all bursts are 0.1 s long, and 10{\%} are {\textgreater} 2.0 s long. Carbon dioxide signals from equivalent sources are stronger in riverine woodland than mopane. Carbon dioxide dispensed at rates of 4–20 L min−1 is detected up to 64 m downwind of the source but peaks are typically {\textless} 10 p.p.m. above threshold. Consequently, host-CO2 signals are obscured during periods of large fluctuations in atmospheric CO2. These results suggest that CO2 is detectable, at least in some circumstances, at tens of metres downwind and hence dispels the notion that its action is limited to that of a short-range attractant.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: African animal trypanosomosis (AAT) is a major constraint to sustainable development of cattle farming in sub-Saharan Africa. The habitat of the tsetse fly vector is increasingly fragmented owing to demographic pressure and shifts in climate, which leads to heterogeneous risk of cyclical transmission both in space and time. In Burkina Faso and Ghana, the most important vectors are riverine species, namely Glossina palpalis gambiensis and G. tachinoides, which are more resilient to human-induced changes than the savannah and forest species. Although many authors studied the distribution of AAT risk both in space and time, spatio-temporal models allowing predictions of it are lacking.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We used datasets generated by various projects, including two baseline surveys conducted in Burkina Faso and Ghana within PATTEC (Pan African Tsetse and Trypanosomosis Eradication Campaign) national initiatives. We computed the entomological inoculation rate (EIR) or tsetse challenge using a range of environmental data. The tsetse apparent density and their infection rate were separately estimated and subsequently combined to derive the EIR using a "one layer-one model" approach. The estimated EIR was then projected into suitable habitat. This risk index was finally validated against data on bovine trypanosomosis. It allowed a good prediction of the parasitological status (r2 = 67{\%}), showed a positive correlation but less predictive power with serological status (r2 = 22{\%}) aggregated at the village level but was not related to the illness status (r2 = 2{\%}).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The presented spatio-temporal model provides a fine-scale picture of the dynamics of AAT risk in sub-humid areas of West Africa. The estimated EIR was high in the proximity of rivers during the dry season and more widespread during the rainy season. The present analysis is a first step in a broader framework for an efficient risk management of climate-sensitive vector-borne diseases.},

abstract = {Female tsetse flies, Glossina pallidipes Austen, caught in artificial refuges were subjected to ovarian dissection and analysed for levels of fat, residual dry weight (RDW) and haematin. There were rather small proportions of flies in ovarian categories 0 and 1, in part due to large losses in the immature and teneral stages at the hottest time of year. The distribution of the female catch among pregnancy days was close to uniform. The wet and dry weights (WW and DW) and RDW of eggs, larvae and pupae increased by 0.821, 0.303 and 0.204 mg respectively, with each mm3 increase in volume. Water accounted for 71.7{\%} of the fat-free WW, and fat for 32.7{\%} of the DW. Between birth and ovulation, fat increased from 2 to 4 mg and RDW from 7 to 11 mg; thoracic RDW increased by 2.5mg and changed little thereafter. Fat levels increased 3.5mg by day 6 of pregnancy, but only 0.5 mg thereafter. Over the same periods RDW corrected to zero haematin (CRDW) increased by 1 and 8 mg respectively. Full-term fat and CRDW levels were 8.2 and 19.4 mg respectively. Cumulative haematin frequencies formed a smooth curve with a slope that increased continuously. The raw data were well fitted by a model where feeding rates increased exponentially and capture probability was independent of haematin content. The mean feeding interval was 60 h; feeding probabilities of {\textgreater}0.9/day were only found in flies that had failed to feed for{\textgreater}72 h. In early pregnancy, fat levels declined with haematin for flies that had fed{\textgreater}36 h previously; by days 5-7 fat levels were maintained at a constant high level for 60 h post-feeding. Fat-haematin graphs for female tsetse cannot be used to estimate rates of fat utilization. Traps sample tsetse with below-average fat and RDW in early and late pregnancy respectively. Refuge samples are less biased than those from traps; they give a better picture of the dynamics of pregnancy in normal flies and facilitate the explanation of existing anomalies.},

abstract = {The epidemiology of tsetse-transmitted trypanosomiasis depends, among other factors, on the proportion of infected flies in a tsetse population. A wide range of intrinsic and extrinsic factors seem to determine the ability of a tsetse fly to become infected and to transmit the parasite. In this paper, we investigated the effect of nutritional stress of reproducing female Glossina morsitans morsitans on the susceptibility of their offspring to trypanosomal infections. Adult female flies that were nutritionally stressed by feeding only once a week, produced pupae with a significant lower weight and offspring with a significant lower fat content as well as a lower baseline immune peptide gene expression. Moreover, infection experiments showed that the emerging teneral flies were significantly more susceptible to a Trypanosoma congolense or Trypanosoma brucei brucei infection than flies emerging from non-starved adult females. These findings suggest that in the field, substantial nutritional stress of adult tsetse flies, as is often experienced during the hot dry season, can increase significantly the vectorial capacity of the emerging teneral flies and thus result in an increased infection rate of the tsetse population. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The opportunities and challenges of Data Sharing are discussed widely in the scholarly sector. The cultures of Data Sharing differ within the scholarly disciplines. Well advanced are for example disciplines like biomedicine and earth sciences. Today, more and more funding agencies require a proper Research Data Management and the possibility of data re-use. Many researchers often see the potential of Data Sharing, but they act cautiously. This situation shows a clear ambivalence between the demand for Data Sharing and the current practice of Data Sharing. Starting from a baseline study on current discussions, practices and developments the article describe the challenges of Open Research Data. The authors briefly discuss the barriers and drivers to Data Sharing. Furthermore, the article analyses strategies and approaches to promote and implement Data Sharing. This comprises an analysis of the current landscape of data repositories, enhanced publications and data papers. In this context the authors also shed light on incentive mechanisms, data citation practises and the interaction between data repositories and journals. In the conclusions the authors outline requirements of a future Data Sharing culture.},

abstract = {Mathematical models of disease can aid understanding of, and provide a framework for, the study of disease spread and control. Vector-borne diseases are not only amongst the most significant diseases but also require tailored mathematics to model the spe- cific biological interactions important in their spread. A key model in vector-borne epidemiology is the Ross-Macdonald ODE model. Simplification of this model using the quasi-equilibrium assumption (QEA) allowed stability and bifurcation analysis to be performed. The QEA was then used to examine the effect of avian malaria upon the Hawaiian honeycreeper, including ecological factors such as predation and climate change. In contrast, amendments to the Ross-Macdonald model can incorporate higher levels of biological detail, specifically age and bite structure in the vector population. This was facilitated via a PDE model which led to the better understanding of biological mechanisms upon disease transmission and control. Disease-free analytic solutions of the PDE were derived, however the complexity introduced by disease necessitated the use of numerical analysis in order to solve the system. This novel PDE model enabled the study of human African trypanosomiasis. Effects of starvation and teneral susceptibility of tsetse were introduced in a way which is not possible using ODE models. This provides a new framework capable of investigating the impact of these on the control of disease.},

abstract = {The nature of developmental buffering processes has been debated extensively, based on both theoretical reasoning and empirical studies. In particular, controversy has focused on the question of whether distinct processes are responsible for canalization, the buffering against environmental or genetic variation, and for developmental stability, the buffering against random variation intrinsic in developmental processes. Here, we address this question for the size and shape of Drosophila melanogaster wings in an experimental design with extensively replicated and fully controlled genotypes. The amounts of variation among individuals and of fluctuating asymmetry differ markedly among genotypes, demonstrating a clear genetic basis for size and shape variability. For wing shape, there is a high correlation between the amounts of variation among individuals and fluctuating asymmetry, which indicates a correspondence between the two types of buffering. Likewise, the multivariate patterns of shape variation among individuals and of fluctuating asymmetry show a close association. For wing size, however, the amounts of individual variation and fluctuating asymmetry are not correlated. There was a significant link between the amounts of variation between wing size and shape, more so for fluctuating asymmetry than for variation among individuals. Overall, these experiments indicate a considerable degree of shared control of individual variation and fluctuating asymmetry, although it appears to differ between traits.},

abstract = {Maternal investment in offspring development is a major determinant of the survival and future reproductive success of both the mother and her young. Mothers might therefore be expected to adjust their investment according to ecological conditions in order to maximise their lifetime fitness. In cooperatively breeding species, where helpers assist breeders with offspring care, the size of the group may also influence maternal investment strategies because the costs of reproduction are shared between breeders and helpers. Here, we use longitudinal records of body mass and life history traits from a wild population of meerkats (Suricata suricatta) to explore the pattern of growth in pregnant females and investigate how the rate of growth varies with characteristics of the litter, environmental conditions, maternal traits and group size. Gestational growth was slight during the first half of pregnancy but was marked and linear from the midpoint of gestation until birth. The rate of gestational growth in the second half of pregnancy increased with litter size, maternal age and body mass, and was higher for litters conceived during the peak of the breeding season when it is hot and wet. Gestational growth rate was lower in larger groups, especially when litter size was small. These results suggest that there are ecological and physiological constraints on gestational growth in meerkats, and that females may also be able to strategically adjust their prenatal investment in offspring according to the likely fitness costs and benefits of a particular breeding attempt. Mothers in larger groups may benefit from reducing their investment because having more helpers might allow them to lower reproductive costs without decreasing breeding success. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

However, whether phenotypic plasticity is beneficial, or if acclimation responses might be constrained to particular ecotypes is generally poorly explored. Here we test the beneficial acclimation hypothesis (BAH) and its alternatives for desiccation resistance to atmospheric moisture in mesic- and xeric-adapted Glossina species. Highly significant interactions among acclimation and test humidity were detected for water loss rates indicative of significant phenotypic plasticity. Ordered-factor anova was unable to reject predictions of the 'drier is better' acclimation hypothesis in xeric Glossina morsitans and mesic G. austeni. Evidence for the 'deleterious acclimation hypothesis' was found for mesic G. palpalis as expected from the moist habitats it typically occupies. By contrast, support for the 'optimal acclimation hypothesis' was found in xeric G. pallidipes. Little support for BAH was obtained in the present study, although other hypotheses, which might enhance fitness within the environments these species are typically exposed to, were supported. However, acclimation responses were not necessarily constrained to xeric/mesic ecotypes which might be expected if adaptation to a particular environment arose as a trade-off between plastic responses and living in a particular habitat. These results highlight the complexity of acclimation responses and suggest an important role for phenotypic plasticity in moderating environmental effects on evolutionary fitness in Glossina.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: CD4 cell count changes in therapy-naive patients were investigated during 7 years of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in an observational cohort. METHODS: Three endpoints were studied: (1) time to {\textgreater}=800 CD4 cells/mm in 5299 therapy-naive patients starting HAART, (2) CD4 cell count changes during 7 years of uninterrupted HAART in a subset of 544 patients, and (3) reaching a plateau in CD4 cell restoration after 5 years of HAART in 366 virologically suppressed patients. RESULTS: Among patients with {\textless}50, 50 to 200, 200 to 350, 350 to 500, and {\textgreater}=500 CD4 cells/mm at baseline, respectively, 20{\%}, 26{\%}, 46{\%}, 73{\%}, and 87{\%} reached {\textgreater}=800 CD4 cells/mm within 7 years of starting HAART. Periods with HIV RNA levels {\textgreater}500 copies/mL and age {\textgreater}=50 years were associated with lesser increases in CD4 cell counts between 6 months and 7 years. Having reached {\textgreater}=800 CD4 cells/mm at 5 years, age {\textgreater}=50 years, and {\textgreater}=1 HIV RNA measurement {\textgreater}1000 copies/mL between 5 and 7 years were associated with a plateau in CD4 cell restoration. CONCLUSIONS: Restoration to CD4 cell counts {\textgreater}=800 cells/mm is feasible within 7 years of HAART in most HIV-infected patients starting with {\textgreater}=350 cells/mm and achieving sufficient suppression of viral replication. Particularly in patients {\textgreater}=50 years of age, it may be beneficial to start earlier than current guidelines recommend. {\textcopyright} 2007 Lippincott Williams {\&} Wilkins, Inc.},

abstract = {Female Glossina pallidipes Austen were captured in odour-baited traps at Rekomitjie Research Station, Zambezi Valley, Zimbabwe during February 1994; 2890 were dissected and assigned to their ovarian age category and day of pregnancy using the lengths of the oocytes and uterine content. For 1838 of these flies, the nutritional state of the mother and her uterine content were estimated separately. It was thereby possible to see how, during pregnancy, the females acquired fat and residual dry weight (RDW) and transfered them to the larva. Newly emerged flies contained 1 mg fat and 6 mg RDW, of which 4 mg was in the thorax (TRDW). Fat hardly increased by the first ovulation; RDW increased by 2.5 mg and 1.5 mg of this increase was in TRDW. Mean haematin levels increased from 2 to 8 microg during each pregnancy. Fat increased from 1.2 mg to 4.5-5 mg by day 7 and was then rapidly transferred to the larva. RDW increased by only 1.8 mg by day 7, but larval RDW increased thereafter by {\textgreater} 6 mg. Amino acids from late-pregnancy bloodmeals are incorporated directly, in the uterine gland, into 'milk' that is taken up rapidly by the larva. Capture probability was highest on day 1 of pregnancy, when nutritional levels were lowest, with lesser peaks on days 5 and 8 when the fly was nourishing a rapidly developing larva. On day 1, the peak of the logarithm of the haematin distribution corresponded to flies estimated to have fed approximately 75 h previously; by day 8 it had shifted to approximately 60 h post-feeding. A model in which feeding rates and capture probabilities increased exponentially with time since feeding accounted for 97{\%} of the variance in log haematin frequencies. On 4/9 days of pregnancy there was no significant decline in fat with haematin content during the lipolytic phase. The rate of decline is not a satisfactory estimate of the rate of fat usage. Flies in this study had longer wings and higher TRDW than those from refuges in an earlier study, but had lower levels of fat and haematin.},

The predominant production system was mixed crop-livestock with farmers owning 2-11 local cattle on holdings between 2 and 5 ha. Approximately 15{\%} of disease episodes in cattle were perceived to be trypanosomiasis, although the farmers' ability to make diagnoses was limited in that over half of the diagnoses were inconsistent with the clinical signs described. Drugs were generally obtained from agro-veterinary shops, and the farmers themselves administered slightly more than half of these.

abstract = {Offspring size and performance in invertebrates often decrease with maternal age or as a response to seasonal environment. In viviparous ectoparasites maternal provision may wholly determine offspring performance outside the host. The viviparous deer ked (Lipoptena cervi), an ectoparasite of cervids, breeds from autumn to spring. We reared deer ked pupae through the reproductive period to investigate whether offspring size and performance vary according to maternal age and offspring environment. We expected that, in autumn, young females would produce the largest offspring to ensure that early-born pupae would survive a long period of winter diapause, and that offspring size would decrease with maternal age and decreasing diapause length. Diapause was associated with a significant weight loss, which reduced survival through post-diapause development. It was thus surprising that the early-born offspring were the smallest, and that size and survival (eventually) increased towards the spring. The variability among offspring in the length of off-host period seems to be an important component of life-history evolution in this ectoparasite, and should be studied further. Unexpected seasonal variation in the offspring size of this blood-feeding ectoparasite may result from changes in female resources due to weakening host condition as the winter progresses.},

abstract = {Tsetse flies Glossina pallidipes Austen and G. morsitans morsitans Westwood deposit their larvae in warthog burrows, in August-November, at Rekomitjie Research Station, Zambezi Valley, Zimbabwe. Artificial burrows, made from 200-l steel drums, were used to sample these flies and to collect their puparia. Sand-filled plastic trays in the burrows served as a substrate for larval deposition. The sand was covered with c. 2 cm of leaf litter after it was shown that only 3{\%} of larvae were deposited on bare sand if both substrates were available. Other burrow modifications - artificially shading the burrow entrance, increasing the relative humidity inside the burrow, or reducing the size of the burrow entrance - significantly decreased deposition rates. The use of burrows in the hot season results in a reduction in the temperature experienced by the puparium towards an assumed optimum level of 26 degrees C. Artificial burrows maintained a mean temperature of 28.5 degrees C during October-November 1998, c. 2.5 degrees C cooler than ambient; earlier work has shown that natural burrows can be c. 5 degrees C cooler than ambient at these times. This may explain why natural burrows in full sunlight were used for larviposition, whereas artificial burrows were used only when they were in deep shade, and why significantly higher proportions of G. pallidipes were found in natural (66{\%}) than in artificial burrows (34{\%}). Better-insulated artificial burrows might produce more puparia with higher proportions of G. pallidipes. Burrows become waterlogged during the rains and may be too cool for optimum puparial development during the rest of the year. The percentages of G. m. morsitans in catches of females from artificial burrows, refuges and odour-baited traps were 34, 26 and {\textless} 10{\%} respectively. Traps are biased in favour of G. pallidipes; artificial burrows may show a bias in favour of G. m. morsitans that is a function of temperature. Artificial warthog burrows provide a convenient way of studying the puparial stage in tsetse and for the first time facilitate the capture of females as they deposit their larvae.},

abstract = {The dipteran clade Calyptratae is comprised of approximately 18 000 described species (12{\%} of the known dipteran diversity) and includes well-known taxa such as houseflies, tsetse flies, blowflies and botflies, which have a close associa- tion with humans. However, the phylogenetic relationships within this insect radiation are very poorly understood and controversial. Here we propose a higher-level phylo- genetic hypothesis for the Calyptratae based on an extensive DNA sequence dataset for 11 noncalyptrate outgroups and 247 calyptrate species representing all commonly accepted families in the Oestroidea and Hippoboscoidea, as well as those of the mus- coid grade. DNA sequences for genes in the mitochondrial (12S, 16S, cytochrome c oxidase subunit I and cytochrome b) and nuclear genome [18S, 28S, the carbamoyl phosphate synthetase region of CAD (rudimentary), Elongation factor one alpha] were used to reconstruct the relationships. We discuss problems relating to the alignment and analysis of large datasets and emphasize the advantages of utilizing a guide tree- based approach for the alignment of the DNA sequences and using the leaf stability index to identify ‘wildcard' taxa whose excessive instability obscures the phylogenetic signal. Our analyses support the monophyly of the Calyptratae and demonstrate that the superfamily Oestroidea is nested within the muscoid grade. We confirm that the monotypic family Mystacinobiidae is an oestroid and further revise the composition of the Oestroidea by demonstrating that the previously unplaced and still undescribed ‘McAlpine's fly' is nested within this superfamily as a probable sister group to Mysta- cinobiidae. Within the Oestroidea we confirm with molecular data that the Calliphori- dae are a paraphyletic grade of lineages. The families Sarcophagidae and Rhiniidae are monophyletic, but support for the monophyly of Tachinidae and Rhinophoridae depends on analytical technique (e.g. parsimony or maximum likelihood). The super- families Hippoboscoidea and Oestroidea are consistently found to be monophyletic, and the paraphyly of the muscoid grade is confirmed. In the overall relationships for the calyptrates, the Hippoboscoidea are sister group to the remaining Calyptratae, and the Fanniidae are sister group to the nonhippoboscoid calyptrates, whose relationships can be summarized as (Muscidae (Oestroidea (Scathophagidae, Anthomyiidae))).},

Any underlying signal from climate change is likely to be revealed by analyses that seek systematic trends across diverse species and geographic regions; however, debates within the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reveal several definitions of a 'systematic trend'. Here, we explore these differences, apply diverse analyses to more than 1,700 species, and show that recent biological trends match climate change predictions. Global meta-analyses documented significant range shifts averaging 6.1 km per decade towards the poles (or metres per decade upward), and significant mean advancement of spring events by 2.3 days per decade. We define a diagnostic fingerprint of temporal and spatial 'sign-switching' responses uniquely predicted by twentieth century climate trends. Among appropriate long-term/large-scale/multi-species data sets, this diagnostic fingerprint was found for 279 species. This suite of analyses generates 'very high confidence' (as laid down by the IPCC) that climate change is already affecting living systems.},

abstract = {A possible explanation for one of the most general trends in animal evolution - rapid divergent evolution of animal genitalia - is that male genitalia are used as courtship devices that influence cryptic female choice. But experimental demonstrations of stimulatory effects of male genitalia on female reproductive processes have generally been lacking. Previous studies of female reproductive physiology in the tsetse fly Glossina morsitans suggested that stimulation during copulation triggers ovulation and resistance to remating. In this study we altered the form of two male genital structures that squeeze the female's abdomen rhythmically in G. morsitans centralis and induced, as predicted, cryptic female choice against the male: sperm storage decreased, while female remating increased. Further experiments in which we altered the female sensory abilities at the site contacted by these male structures during copulation, and severely altered or eliminated the stimuli the male received from this portion of his genitalia, suggested that the effects of genital alteration on sperm storage were due to changes in tactile stimuli received by the female, rather than altered male behavior. These data support the hypothesis that sexual selection by cryptic female choice has been responsible for the rapid divergent evolution of male genitalia in Glossina; limitations of this support are discussed. It appears that a complex combination of stimuli trigger female ovulation, sperm storage, and remating, and different stimuli affect different processes in G. morsitans, and that the same processes are controlled differently in G. pallidipes. This puzzling diversity in female triggering mechanisms may be due to the action of sexual selection.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 Elsevier Ltd Organisms respond to environmental stimuli in ways that optimize survival and reproduction. Tsetse fly life-history is characterized by high investment in progeny by the pregnant female and low birth rate. This places constraints on tsetse populations across the sub-Saharan biotopes they colonize where extreme climatic conditions militate against survival. Controlling metabolic rate is crucial in biotopes where daily swings in temperature can exceed 20 °C. Tsetse acquire their nutrient requirements from the blood meal. These diurnal flies are otherwise confined for most of their lives to perching sites in the shade. At these locations they are simultaneously threatened by vertebrate and invertebrate predators. Here we describe behaviours of the East African tsetse Glossina pallidipes Austen (Diptera: Glossinidae) that permit it to reduce risk daily. Newly-emerged flies remain immobile at emergence in the photophase but scotophase-emerging flies walk away within seconds to climb (negative geotaxis) vertical substrates to find a perch off the ground. Flies of all ages show the ability to fly in almost total darkness (1.10−5lux) in the scotophase to perch on the upper side of horizontally suspended 1 cm diameter bars, simulating branches of vegetation, but perch under the same bars during the photophase. This underlines the predilection of tsetse for objects with a linear aspect that provide a vantage point and shade. Mature G. pallidipes can discriminate between horizontally suspended bars of different diameter and shape. Flicker fusion frequency values established by optomotor and retinogram recordings reveal a higher visual acuity in mature compared to newly-emerged tsetse.},

abstract = {An analysis of the population changes of Glossina palpalis palpalis (R.-D.) during and after two insecticide trials in Ivory Coast revealed that the effects of insecticide application depend very strongly on the characteristics of the population ecology of the fly, which showed considerable local variation. At sites with high fly populations and low natural mortality rates, the populations declined rapidly during the spray period as the insecticide killed a large proportion of the local, mainly resident, population. The high resilience of the populations, however, permitted rapid recovery, largely through reinvasion from neighbouring areas, so the reduction in fly numbers lasted for only 3-4 months at a time of year when, in the absence of insecticide, the population showed a significant seasonal decline lasting for up to three months. At other sites, with low populations and high natural mortality rates, the local populations were supported chiefly by immigrants and therefore insecticides only affected a very small proportion of the total population and thus did not cause an immediate decline in fly numbers. The low resilience of these populations, however, means that any repeated low additional mortality (such as that caused by removal trapping or deterioration of environmental conditions) would cause the populations to decline. Thus at both types of site, but for rather different reasons, single or short-term insecticide applications had a limited effect on the populations, and longterm, repeated control procedures are considered to be the only ones likely to reduce the populations significantly; through economic necessity these must rely on low-technology devices such as insecticide-impregnated screens or traps. {\textcopyright} 1984, Cambridge University Press.

abstract = {Growth rates of tsetse populations were estimated by calculating the dominant eigenvalues of appropriate Leslie matrices. The individual effects of four variables (pre-adult and adult survival probability, interlarval period and pupal duration), have been investigated by varying each one over a wide range of values, while the other three are held constant. R, the log of the growth rate, was found to vary approximately linearly with adult and pre-adult death rate; a 1{\%} change in the adult death rate causes approximately a 10-fold change in R. R varies linearly with the log of fecundity and of the pupal duration. An increase in the pupal duration results in a decrease in the growth rate for populations which have a positive growth rate, but an increase for populations which have a negative growth rate. For a population at equilibrium, a change in the pupal duration has no effect. Small changes in fecundity have less effect on the growth rate than small changes in the death rate; this fact is advanced as an important contributor to the generally very cautious nature of female tsetse, and their aversion to man, particularly as a potential host. A simple linear model is described which relates R to all four variables and their first order interactions. The model is used to produce a set of graphs which encapsulate the relationship between the growth rate and the vital parameters over a wide range of values. It is also used to draw the loci on one side of which tsetse populations grow, and on the other of which they decline. Population resilience is discussed in relation to the problem of tsetse eradication; it is concluded that if one can impose and sustain an added mortality of 4{\%} per day on any female tsetse population then it must go extinct, regardless of the strength of the density dependent processes; and it seems likely that in most field conditions only an added 2-3{\%} is required. It is pointed out that ground and aerial spraying techniques produce much higher daily mortalities than this, but they may often not be sustained for sufficiently long to achieve eradication. When odour-baited targets are used the increased death rate is much smaller, but it can be sustained as required; recent work in Zimbabwe shows that there is a good correspondence between the calculated imposed death rate and the observed rate of decline of tsetse populations.},

abstract = {This paper considers approaches to modeling the dynamics of infectious disease and the application of such models to nematode parasite infections in ruminants. Particularly, these models are developed to account for host genetics and may be used to assess the effects of using genetics to control nematode infections. Three main issues are critically examined: the infection transmission cycle from pasture to host to pasture, the expected genetic relationships between resistance and performance, and the risks of parasite evolution in response to genetic changes in the host. To obtain answers that are realistic and of practical use, the modeling approaches require a solid grounding in biology. This biology is formalized and described using mathematical techniques, with the models parameterized using experimental or field data. Transmission dynamics have been quantified by modeling and are backed by strong experimental data. Selection for resistance will be successful in reducing egg output, pasture larval contamination and hence subsequent larval challenge. Modeling frameworks have been developed to predict genetic relationships between resistance to infectious disease and performance in general, and genetic correlations predicted for nematode resistance are close to mean published values. These predicted correlations strengthen as the larval challenge increases and the dietary (protein) adequacy decreases, however modeling challenges remain. Lastly, although convincing experimental data is not yet available, arguments based on modeling suggest that the risks of parasite evolution in response to genetic changes in the host should be less than the risks arising from other control strategies, such as anthelmintics. Thus, modeling techniques predict that selective breeding for resistance should be an effective and sustainable complementary control measure. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Endemic animal diseases such as tsetse-transmitted trypanosomosis are a constant drain on the financial resources of African livestock keepers and on the productivity of their livestock. Knowing where the potential benefits of removing animal trypanosomosis are distributed geographically would provide crucial evidence for prioritising and targeting cost-effective interventions as well as a powerful tool for advocacy. To this end, a study was conducted on six tsetse-infested countries in Eastern Africa: Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan and Uganda. First, a map of cattle production systems was generated, with particular attention to the presence of draught and dairy animals. Second, herd models for each production system were developed for two scenarios: with or without trypanosomosis. The herd models were based on publications and reports on cattle productivity (fertility, mortality, yields, sales), from which the income from, and growth of cattle populations were estimated over a twenty-year period. Third, a step-wise spatial expansion model was used to estimate how cattle populations might migrate to new areas when maximum stocking rates are exceeded. Last, differences in income between the two scenarios were mapped, thus providing a measure of the maximum benefits that could be obtained from intervening against tsetse and trypanosomosis. For this information to be readily mappable, benefits were calculated per bovine and converted to US{\$} per square kilometre. Results indicate that the potential benefits from dealing with trypanosomosis in Eastern Africa are both very high and geographically highly variable. The estimated total maximum benefit to livestock keepers for the whole of the study area amounts to nearly US{\$} 2.5 billion, discounted at 10{\%} over twenty years - an average of approximately US{\$} 3300 per square kilometre of tsetse-infested area - but with great regional variation from less than US{\$} 500 per square kilometre to well over US{\$} 10,000. The greatest potential benefits accrue to Ethiopia, because of its very high livestock densities and the importance of animal traction, but also to parts of Kenya and Uganda. In general, the highest benefit levels occur on the fringes of the tsetse infestations. The implications of the models' assumptions and generalisations are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2013 Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.},

abstract = {For tsetse (Glossina spp.), the vectors of human and animal trypanosomiases, the physiological mechanisms linking variation in population dynamics with changing weather conditions have not been well established. Here, we investigate high- and low-temperature tolerance in terms of activity limits and survival in a natural population of adult Glossina pallidipes from eastern Zambia. Due to increased interest in chilling flies for handling and aerial dispersal in sterile insect technique control and eradication programmes, we also provide further detailed investigation of low-temperature responses. In wild-caught G. pallidipes, the probability of survival for 50{\%} of the population at low-temperatures was at 3.7, 8.9 and 9.6 °C (95{\%} CIs: ±1.5 °C) for 1, 2 and 3 h treatments, respectively. At high temperatures, it was estimated that treatments at 37.9, 36.2 and 35.6 °C (95{\%} CIs: ±0.5 °C) would yield 50{\%} population survival for 1, 2 and 3 h, respectively. Significant effects of time and temperature were detected at both temperature extremes (GLZ, p{\textless}0.05 in all cases) although a time-temperature interaction was only detected at high temperatures (p{\textless}0.0001). We synthesized data from four other Kenyan populations and found that upper critical thermal limits showed little variation among populations and laboratory treatments (range: 43.9-45.0 °C; 0.25 °C/min heating rate), although reduction to more ecologically relevant heating rates (0.06 °C/min) reduce these values significantly from ∼44.4 to 40.6 °C, thereby providing a causal explanation for why tsetse distribution may be high-temperature limited. By contrast, low-temperature limits showed substantial variation among populations and acclimation treatments (range: 4.5-13.8 °C; 0.25 °C/min), indicating high levels of inter-population variability. Ecologically relevant cooling rates (0.06 °C/min) suggest tsetses are likely to experience chill coma temperatures under natural conditions (∼20-21 °C). The results from acute hardening experiments in the Zambian population demonstrate limited ability to improve low-temperature tolerance over short (hourly) timescales after non-lethal pre-treatments. In flies which survived chilling, recovery times were non-linear with plateaus between 2-6 and 8-12 °C. Survival times ranged between 4 and 36 h and did not vary between flies which had undergone chill coma by comparison with flies which had not, even after factoring body condition into the analyses (p{\textgreater}0.5 in all cases). However, flies with low chill coma values had the highest body water and fat content, indicating that when energy reserves are depleted, low-temperature tolerance may be compromised. Overall, these results suggest that physiological mechanisms may provide insight into tsetse population dynamics, hence distribution and abundance, and support a general prediction for reduced geographic distribution under future climate warming scenarios. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Glossina brevipalpis and G. austeni are the vectors of nagana in cattle in N.E. KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Before intervention through target technology could be applied successfully to control these species, studies were needed on the two species' attraction to host odours, trapping, dispersal, feeding responses and their distribution. Studies with host odours, to find an attractive odour for G. austeni, proved that CO2 was the main attractive component for this species. The existing chemicals of the best SA odour remained to be the main attractive components for G. brevipalpis. A bicoloured electric-blue/black XT was refined to use in distribution surveys. The newly developed H trap was effective in catching relatively high numbers of both species. This trap was applied in population dispersal studies in that live tsetse could be captured for mark-release-recapture trials. These studies revealed that target densities for G. brevipalpis and G. austeni of about 4 and 7 targets/km2, respectively, should be effective for their successful control with odour-baited insecticide-impregnated targets.  G. austeni was confined to densely shaded areas but it traversed short distances of up to 345 m of “unsuitable” habitat between pockets of vegetation. G. brevipalpis was considered a much more mobile fly and traversed wide areas of 1,345 m. Both species were readily attracted to cattle, but not to goats nor bushpig. They also fed more readily on cattle and would also feed at night. It was recommended that cattle could be applied as mobile targets to control both species in areas where cattle predominate.    Tsetse surveys showed that there were two distinct bands of distribution for G. brevipalpis. The main sources of this species were the game reserves and other natural areas. G. austeni had a more widespread north to south distribution. A Geographic Information System was used to map tsetse distribution and their apparent densities. This was collated with trypanosomosis incidence and prevalence, diptank distribution, land tenure/designation, landcover and vegetation types. Finally, a strategy was proposed for the monitoring and sustainable integrated control and eventual eradication of both tsetse species. With this proposed strategy eradication could be achieved within 8–12 years.},

abstract = {Background Control operations targeting Animal African Trypanosomiasis and its primary vector, the tsetse, were covering approximately 128,000 km2 of Africa in 2001, which is a mere 1.3{\%} of the tsetse infested area. Although extensive trypanosomiasis and tsetse (T{\&}T) control operations have been running since the beginning of the 20th century, Animal African Trypanosomiasis is still a major constraint of livestock production in sub-Saharan Africa.   Methodology/Principal Findings We performed a systematic review of the existing literature describing T{\&}T control programmes conducted in a selection of five African countries, namely Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Ethiopia, Uganda and Zambia, between 1980 and 2015. Sixty-eight documents were eventually selected from those identified by the database search. This was supplemented with information gathered through semi-structured interviews conducted with twelve key informants recruited in the study countries and selected based on their experience and knowledge of T{\&}T control. The combined information from these two sources was used to describe the inputs, processes and outcomes from 23 major T{\&}T control programmes implemented in the study countries. Although there were some data gaps, involvement of the target communities and sustainability of the control activities were identified as the two main issues faced by these programmes. Further, there was a lack of evaluation of these control programmes, as well as a lack of a standardised methodology to conduct such evaluations.   Conclusions/Significance Past experiences demonstrated that coordinated and sustained control activities require careful planning, and evidence of successes, failures and setbacks from past control programmes represent a mine of information. As there is a lack of evaluation of these programmes, these data have not been fully exploited for the design, analyses and justification of future control programmes.},

abstract = {Resource availability plays a key role in driving variation in somatic growth and body condition, and the factors determining access to resources vary considerably across life stages. Parents and carers may exert important influences in early life, when individuals are nutritionally dependent, with abiotic environmental effects having stronger influences later in development as individuals forage independently. Most studies have measured specific factors influencing growth across development, or have compared relative influences of different factors within specific life stages. Such studies may not capture whether early-life factors continue have delayed effects at later stages, or if social factors change when individuals become nutritionally independent and adults become competitors for, rather than providers of, food. Here, we examined variation in the influence of the abiotic, social and maternal environment on growth across life stages in a wild population of cooperatively breeding meerkats. Cooperatively breeding vertebrates are ideal for investigating environmental influences on growth. In addition to experiencing highly variable abiotic conditions, cooperative breeders are typified by heterogeneity both among breeders, with mothers varying in age and social status, and in the number of carers present. Recent rainfall had a consistently marked effect on growth across life stages, yet other seasonal terms only influenced growth during stages when individuals were growing fastest. Group size and maternal dominance status had positive effects on growth during the period of nutritional dependence on carers, yet did not influence mass at emergence (at one month) or growth at independent stages ({\textgreater}4 months). Pups born to older mothers were lighter at one month of age, and subsequently grew faster as subadults. Males grew faster than females during the juvenile and subadult stage only. Our findings demonstrate the complex ways in which the external environment influences development in a cooperative mammal. Individuals are most sensitive to social and maternal factors during the period of nutritional dependence on carers whereas direct environmental effects are relatively more important later in development. Understanding the way in which environmental sensitivity varies across life stages is likely to be an important consideration in predicting trait responses to environmental change.},

abstract = {A study on the seasonal variation in population structure and status of the African buffalo (Syncerus caffer), the greater kudu (Tragelaphus strepsiceros) and the common impala (Aepyceros melampus) was carried out in the Mana Pools National Park floodplain, Zimbabwe. Data was collected during the wet (February) and dry (September) seasons of 2012. The simple random sampling method was employed in transect placement. A total of 10 transects were sampled. The line transect method was used to estimate dry and wet season populations of buffalo, kudu and impala. Results from the two tailed t-test showed no significant variation for the populations of kudu (P{\textgreater}0.05) and buffalo (P{\textgreater}0.05) with season. However, impala population varied significantly with season (P{\textless}0.05). Female biased sex ratios were observed in all the species. The sex ratio of adult male to adult female for buffalo, kudu and impala was 1:1.78, 1:2.75 and 1:1.48 respectively. Age composition for buffalo comprised 53.13{\%} (n=102) adult, 35.94{\%} (n=69) sub adults and 10.94{\%} (n=21) juveniles. For kudu, 47.37{\%} (n=44) were adults 42.11{\%} (n=38) were subadults and 10.53{\%} (n=11) were juveniles. Impala age composition comprised of 46.27{\%} (n=689) adults, 45.53{\%} (n=679) sub-adults and 8.2{\%} (n=121) juveniles. Group size for impala significantly changed with season (P{\textless}0.05) and no significant variation in group sizes for buffalo and kudu were observed (P{\textgreater}0.05). Dry season mean group sizes for buffalo, kudu and impala were 9.8, 3.6 and 14.1 respectively. The population of buffalo declined from 446 in 1995 to 174 in 2012. The populations of kudu and impala showed an increasing trend between 1995 and 2012. Results from this study suggest that seasonal variation in forage availability could be the primary factor influencing the status of herbivores in the MPNP floodplain. There is an urgent need for management to revise staff and ration quotas for herbivores and increase law enforcement efforts to assure the sustainable management of herbivores in MPNP.},

Forensic entomologists use size and developmental stages to estimate blowfly age, and from those, a Postmortem Interval. Calliphorids are very interesting in forensic sciences from an applied point of view, because they provide relevant evidence for estimating the Postmortem Interval. Since such estimates are generally accurate but often lack precision, particularly in the older developmental stages, so there is a need of some alternative aging methods. The range of techniques available for age grading of adult insects is reviewed, with particular emphasis on species of medical importance. The techniques described include pteridine fluorescence analysis, internal morphological analysis, cuticular hydrocarbon analysis, gene expression analysis, cuticular banding pattern analysis, volatile organic compounds analysis released by larvae and pupae.},

@article{Vitousek1997,
abstract = {Abstract. Nitrogen is a key element controlling the species composition, diversity, dynamics, and functioning of many terrestrial, freshwater, and marine ecosystems. Many of the original plant species living in these ecosystems are adapted to, and function optimally in, soils and solutions with low levels of available nitrogen. The growth and dynamics of herbivore populations, and ultimately those of their predators, also are affected by N. Agriculture, combustion of fossil fuels, and other human activities have altered the global cycle of N substantially, generally increasing both the availability and the mobility of N over large regions of Earth. The mobility of N means that while most deliberate applications of N occur locally, their influence spreads regionally and even globally. Moreover, many of the mobile forms of N themselves have environmental consequences. Although most nitrogen inputs serve human needs such as agricultural production, their environmental conse- quences are serious and long term. Based on our review of available scientific evidence, we are certain that human alterations of the nitrogen cycle have: 1) approximately doubled the rate of nitrogen input into the terrestrial nitrogen cycle, with these rates still increasing; 2) increased concentrations of the potent greenhouse gas N20 globally, and increased concentrations of other oxides of nitrogen that drive the formation of photochemical smog over large regions of Earth; 3) caused losses of soil nutrients, such as calcium and potassium, that are essential for the long-term maintenance of soil fertility; 4) contributed substantially to the acidification of soils, streams, and lakes in several regions; and 5) greatly increased the transfer of nitrogen through rivers to estuaries and coastal oceans. In addition, based on our review of available scientific evidence we are confident that human alterations of the nitrogen cycle have: 6) increased the quantity of organic carbon stored within terrestrial ecosystems; 7) accelerated losses of biological diversity, especially losses of plants adapted to efficient use of nitrogen, and losses of the animals and microorganisms that depend on them; and 8) caused changes in the composition and functioning of estuarine and nearshore ecosystems, and contributed to long-term declines in coastal marine fisheries.},

abstract = {An agent-based model (AMB) used to simulate the spread of Human African Trypanosomiasis is presented together with the results of simulations of a focus of the disease. This model is a completely spatialized approach taking into account a series of often overlooked parameters such as human behaviour (activity-related movements), the density and mobility of the disease vectors-tsetse flies (Glossina spp.)-and the influence of other tsetse feeding hosts (livestock and wild animal populations). The agents that represent humans and tsetse flies move in a spatially structured environment managed by specialized location agents. Existing compartmental mathematical models governed by differential equations fail to incorporate the spatial dimension of the disease transmission. Furthermore, on a small scale, transmission is unrealistically represented by entities less than one. This ABM was tested with data from one village of the Bipindi sleeping sickness focus (southern Cameroon) and with obtained realistic simulations of stable transmission involving an animal reservoir. In varying different spatial configurations, we observe that the stability of spread is linked to the spatial complexity (number of heterogeneous locations). The prevalence is very sensitive to the human densities and to the number of tsetse flies initially infected in a given location. A relatively low and durable prevalence is obtained with shortening the phase I. In addition, we discuss some upgrading possibilities, in particular the linkage to a Geographical Information System (GIS). The agent-based approach offers new ways to understanding the spread of the disease and a tool to evaluate risk and test control strategies. {\textcopyright} 2003 Acad{\'{e}}mie des sciences.

Tsetse abundance, trypanosome herd average prevalence (HAP), herd average anaemia (HAA) and herd average packed cell volume (HA-PCV) were investigated at three communal diptanks located at the edge of Hluhluwe-iMfolozi Park by monthly sampling from June 2006 – November 2007. Seasonal trypanosome surveys were conducted at seven other communal diptanks. Glossina brevipalpis prevalence was high at two of the diptanks, Mvutshini and Ekuphindisweni, but low at Ocilwane, whilst G. austeni was only collected from Mvutshini. This high and low tsetse challenge presented different disease scenarios. Cattle at Mvutshini and Ekuphindisweni had the highest HAP of 12.3{\%} and 8.9{\%} respectively, both significantly different (p = 0.001) from the HAP obtained from cattle at Ocilwane (2.9{\%}). These two cattle herds also had the highest HAA, 27.7{\%} and 33.4{\%} respectively, whilst cattle at Ocilwane had the lowest, 11.1{\%} (p = 0.001). Conversely, cattle at Ocilwane had the highest HA-PCV, ranging between 29.0{\%} and 32.0{\%}, whilst cattle at Mvutshini and Ekuphindisweni had the lowest HA-PCV (24.0{\%} – 29.0{\%}). By combining the data from the three diptanks (1318 observations), 62.0{\%} of the infected cattle were found anaemic, compared to 20.0{\%} in the uninfected group. Trypanosome seasonal surveys showed that cattle at all the seven diptanks were infected with trypanosomes; mean HAP, HAA and HA-PCV of 10.2{\%}, 46.6{\%} and 23.7{\%}, respectively. This study generated information on the epidemiological factors related to the wide spread of trypanosome-infected cattle and tsetse flies. Trypanosomosis is a disease of economic importance impacting the livelihood of resource-poor farmers in NKZN.},

abstract = {Patterns in species incidence and compositional turnover are central to understanding what drives biodiversity. Here we propose zeta ($\zeta$) diversity, the number of species shared by multiple assemblages, as a concept and metric that unifies incidence-based diversity measures, patterns, and relationships. Unlike other measures of species compositional turnover, zeta diversity partitioning quantifies the complete set of diversity components for multiple assemblages, comprehensively representing the spatial structure of multispecies distributions. To illustrate the application and ecological value of zeta diversity, we show how it scales with sample number, grain, and distance. Zeta diversity reconciles several different biodiversity patterns, including the species accumulation curve, the species-area relationship, multispecies occupancy patterns, and scaling of species endemism. Exponential and power-law forms of zeta diversity are associated with stochastic versus niche assembly processes. Zeta diversity may provide new insights on biodiversity patterns, the processes driving them, and their response to environmental change.},

abstract = {Vector-borne diseases continue to contribute significantly to the global burden of disease, and cause epidemics that disrupt health security and cause wider socioeconomic impacts around the world. All are sensitive in different ways to weather and climate conditions, so that the ongoing trends of increasing temperature and more variable weather threaten to undermine recent global progress against these diseases. Here, we review the current state of the global public health effort to address this challenge, and outline related initiat-ives by the World Health Organization (WHO) and its partners. Much of the debate to date has centred on attribution of past changes in disease rates to cli-mate change, and the use of scenario-based models to project future changes in risk for specific diseases. While these can give useful indications, the unavoid-able uncertainty in such analyses, and contingency on other socioeconomic and public health determinants in the past or future, limit their utility as decision-support tools. For operational health agencies, the most pressing need is the strengthening of current disease control efforts to bring down cur-rent disease rates and manage short-term climate risks, which will, in turn, increase resilience to long-term climate change. The WHO and partner agencies are working through a range of programmes to (i) ensure political support and financial investment in preventive and curative interventions to bring down current disease burdens; (ii) promote a comprehensive approach to climate risk management; (iii) support applied research, through definition of global and regional research agendas, and targeted research initiatives on priority diseases and population groups.},

abstract = {Impact of reproductive processes upon female health has yielded conflicting results; particularly in relation to the role of reproduction-associated stress. We used the viviparous tsetse fly to determine if lactation, birth and involution lead to damage from oxidative stress (OS) that impairs subsequent reproductive cycles. Tsetse females carry an intrauterine larva to full term at each pregnancy cycle, and lactate to nourish them with milk secretions produced by the accessory gland ( = milk gland) organ. Unlike most K-strategists, tsetse females lack an apparent period of reproductive senescence allowing the production of 8-10 progeny over their entire life span. In a lactating female, over 47{\%} of the maternal transcriptome is associated with the generation of milk proteins. The resulting single larval offspring weighs as much as the mother at birth. In studying this process we noted an increase in specific antioxidant enzyme (AOE) transcripts and enzymatic activity at critical times during lactation, birth and involution in the milk gland/fat body organ and the uterus. Suppression of superoxide dismutase (sod) decreased fecundity in subsequent reproductive cycles in young mothers and nearly abolished fecundity in geriatric females. Loss of fecundity was in part due to the inability of the mother to produce adequate milk to support larval growth. Longevity was also impaired after sod knockdown. Generation of OS in virgin females through exogenous treatment with hydrogen peroxide at times corresponding to pregnancy intervals reduced survival, which was exacerbated by sod knockdown. AOE expression may prevent oxidative damage associated with the generation of nutrients by the milk gland, parturition and milk gland breakdown. Our results indicate that prevention of OS is essential for females to meet the growing nutritional demands of juveniles during pregnancy and to repair the damage that occurs at birth. This process is particularly important for females to remain fecund during the latter portion of their lifetime.},

A large number of Trypanosoma brucei isolates (88) were collected from a variety of hosts (man, cattle, pigs and tsetse) from villages within a 10 km radius and were analysed for variation in isoenzyme patterns, restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) in repetitive DNA sequences and susceptibility to human serum. The human infective stocks form a clearly distinguishable population when compared with other stocks circulating in the domestic cattle reservoir. The data here support the occurrence of genetic exchange between the cattle stocks while an 'epidemic' population structure involving limited genetic exchange is a characteristic of the human infective stocks. Furthermore, it is shown that when both RFLP and isoenzyme analysis are carried out most stocks appear to have individual genotypes.

We calculated stage-specific development times, age-specific mortality and fecundity (18.4 eggs/female symbol/wk), and stage-specific and total preadult mortality (31.6{\%}), and the weekly intrinsic rate of natural increase (ro = 0.096), the finite population growth rate (lambda = 1.109), the net reproductive rate (R0 = 60.45), and the generation time (T = 46.34 wk). Elasticity analysis showed that the dominant life-history trait determining lambda was survival (particularly the adult female's survival). Adult females dominated the stage-specific reproductive value, and the egg stage dominated the stable stage distribution (SSD). The damping ratio (rho = 1.096) suggests a relatively rapid period of recovery to a disturbed SSD. Results were compared with one previous study and conform relatively well, considering that environmental conditions were not the same. We estimated the colonizing ability of P. geniculatus, using as a criterion the ro/b index, and obtained the value of 0.74, an indicator of a good colonizer, and similar to well-known invasive species such as Rhodnius prolixus and Triatoma infestans. The life history traits and demographic parameters here presented for P. geniculatus are discussed in terms of their usefulness for evolutionary studies and vector control activities.},

abstract = {For species which bear unique markings, such as natural spot patterning, field work has become increasingly more reliant on visual identification to recognize and catalog particular specimens or to monitor individuals within populations. While many species of interest exhibit characteristic markings that in principle allow individuals to be identified from photographs, scientists are often faced with the task of matching observations against databases of hundreds or thousands of images. We present a novel technique for automated identification of manta rays (Manta alfredi and Manta birostris) by means of a pattern-matching algorithm applied to images of their ventral surface area. Automated visual identification has recently been developed for several species. However, such methods are typically limited to animals that can be photographed above water, or whose markings exhibit high contrast and appear in regular constellations. While manta rays bear natural patterning across their ventral surface, these patterns vary greatly in their size, shape, contrast, and spatial distribution. Our method is the first to have proven successful at achieving high matching accuracies on a large corpus of manta ray images taken under challenging underwater conditions. Our method is based on automated extraction and matching of keypoint features using the Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) algorithm. In order to cope with the considerable variation in quality of underwater photographs, we also incorporate preprocessing and image enhancement steps. Furthermore, we use a novel pattern-matching approach that results in better accuracy than the standard SIFT approach and other alternative methods. We present quantitative evaluation results on a data set of 720 images of manta rays taken under widely different conditions. We describe a novel automated pattern representation and matching method that can be used to identify individual manta rays from photographs. The method has been incorporated into a website (mantamatcher.org) which will serve as a global resource for ecological and conservation research. It will allow researchers to manage and track sightings data to establish important life-history parameters as well as determine other ecological data such as abundance, range, movement patterns, and structure of manta ray populations across the world.},

abstract = {One of the most sweeping of all patterns in morphological evolution is that animal genitalia tend to diverge more rapidly than do other structures. Abundant indirect evidence supports the cryptic female choice (CFC) explanation of this pattern, which supposes that male genitalia often function to court females during copulation; but direct experimental demonstrations of a stimulatory function have been lacking. In this study, we altered the form of two male genital structures that squeeze the female's abdomen rhythmically in Glossina pallidipes flies. As predicted by theory, this induced CFC against the male: ovulation and sperm storage decreased, while female remating increased. Further experiments showed that these effects were due to changes in tactile stimuli received by the female from the male's altered genitalia, and were not due to other possible changes in the males due to alteration of their genital form. Stimulation from male genital structures also induces females to permit copulation to occur. Together with previous studies of tsetse reproductive physiology, these data constitute the most complete experimental confirmation that sexual selection (probably by CFC) acts on the stimulatory properties of male genitalia.},

abstract = {The hypothetical impact of aerial spraying on tsetse fly populations is investigated. Spray cycles are scheduled at intervals two days short of the first interlarval period and halted once the last of the female flies that originated from pre-spray-deposited pupae have been sprayed twice. The effect of temperature on the aerial spraying of tsetse, through its reproductive cycle and general population dynamics, is of particular interest, given that cooler weather is preferred for the settling of insecticidal droplets. Spray efficacy is found to come at a price due to the greater number of cycles necessitated by cooler weather. The extra cost is argued to be worth while. Pupae, still in the ground at the end of spraying, are identified as the main threat to a successful operation. They are slightly more vulnerable at the low temperature extreme of tsetse habitat (16°C), when the cumulative, natural pupal mortality is high. One can otherwise base one's expectations on the closeness with which the time to the third last spray approaches one puparial duration. A disparity of anything close to the length of a spray cycle advocates caution, whereas one which comes close to vanishing should be interpreted as being auspicious. Three such key temperatures, just below which one can anticipate an improved outcome and just above which caution should be exercised, are 17.146°C, 19.278°C and 23.645°C. A refinement of the existing formulae for the puparial duration and the first interlarval period might be prudent in the South African context of a sympatric Glossina brevipalpis-Glossina austeni, tsetse population. The resulting aerial spraying strategy would then be formulated using a G. brevipalpis puparial duration and a G. austeni first interlarval period. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The dispersal, population dynamics, and age structure of two Rift Valley Fever Virus (Phlebovirus: Bunyaviridae) (RVFV) vectors, Aedes vexans Meigen and Culex poicilipes Theobald, were investigated in northern Senegal. The main objective was to investigate possible factors that mediate RVFV emergence and propagation at a site where humans and livestock live in proximity to temporary surface pools. In mark–release–recapture studies, recapture rates of 0.18{\%} (156/85,500) and 3.46{\%} (201/5,800) were obtained for Ae. vexans and Cx. poicilipes, respectively. The number of mosquitoes recaptured decreased with increasing distance from the release point and over time. The estimated daily survival rate for released females ranged from 91 to 96{\%} for Ae. vexans and 70–79{\%} for Cx. poicilipes. The maximum time after release when marked mosquitoes were collected was 23 and 12 d for Ae. vexans and Cx. poicilipes, respectively. The maximum distances from the release point that marked females were recaptured was 620 and 550 m for Ae vexans and Cx. poicilipes, respectively. Rainfall periodicity was a key factor controlling Ae. vexans population abundance. In contrast, rainfall had no discernible effect on the fluctuation of Cx. poicilipes numbers. The involvement of these two species in the transmission of RVFV is discussed with respect to their longevity and daily survival rate.},

Some holometabolous insects (likemosquitoes, fruit flies) show a pattern wheremortality rate decelerates at older ages, whereas other holometabolous insects (bruchid beetles) and hemimetabolous insects (cotton stainers, milkweed bugs, and kissing bugs) show an age-specific mortality pattern that increases through all ages. Kissing bugs are strictly hematophagous and are vectors of Trypanosoma cruzi Chagas, the etiologic agent of Chagas disease. Here, we tested whether cohort data from the dry forest kissing bug, Rhodnius neglectus Lent (Hemiptera: Reduviidae), supports an increase ofmortal- ity rate that decelerates with age.We analyzed the age-specific mortality pattern of a cohort of 250 individuals of R. neglectus.We used a suite of seven models with different degrees of complexity, to model age-dependent forms of change inmortality rate increase in R. neglectus in the laboratory.We used the Akaike model selection criterion to choose between models that consider absence or pres- ence of mortality deceleration. Five of the seven models (logistic, Gavrilovs, Gompertz, DeMoivre, and exponential) showed a statistically significant fit to the mortality rate.Weak late-age mortality deceleration in R. neglectus was supported by the best fit (logistic model), and this result is consistent with predictions of the disposable soma theory of senescence},

Current conservation strategies by the Zambian government of turning all game reserves into state-protected National Parks (NPs) and game management areas (GMAs) have led to the expansion of the wildlife and tsetse population in the Luangwa and Zambezi valley ecosystem. This ecological niche lies in the common tsetse fly belt that harbors the highest tsetse population density in Southern Africa. Ecological factors such as climate, vegetation and rainfall found in this niche allow for a favorable interplay between wild reservoir hosts and vector tsetse flies. These ecological factors that influence the survival of a wide range of wildlife species provide adequate habitat for tsetse flies thereby supporting the coexistence of disease reservoir hosts and vector tsetse flies leading to prolonged persistence of trypanosomiasis in the area. On the other hand, increase in anthropogenic activities poses a significant threat of reducing the tsetse and wildlife habitat in the area. Herein, we demonstrate that while conservation of wildlife and biodiversity is an important preservation strategy of natural resources, it could serve as a long-term reservoir of wildlife trypanosomiasis.},

abstract = {Explaining why organisms schedule reproduction over their lifetimes in the various ways that they do is an enduring challenge in biology. An influential theoretical prediction states that organisms should increasingly invest in reproduction as they approach the end of their life. An apparent mismatch of empirical data with this prediction has been attributed to age-related constraints on the ability to reproduce. Here we present a general framework for the evolution of age-related reproductive trajectories. Instead of characterizing an organism by its age, we characterize it by its physiological condition. We develop a common currency that if maximized at each time guarantees the whole life history is optimal. This currency integrates reproduction, mortality and changes in condition. We predict that under broad conditions it will be optimal for organisms to invest less in reproduction as they age, thus challenging traditional interpretations of age-related traits and renewing debate about the extent to which observed life histories are shaped by constraint versus adaptation. Our analysis gives a striking illustration of the differences between an age-based and a condition-based approach to life-history theory. It also provides a unified account of not only standard life-history models but of related models involving the allocation of limited resources. {\textcopyright} 2009 The Royal Society},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Trypanocidal drugs have been used to control African animal trypanosomosis for several decades. In Ethiopia, these drugs are available from both authorized (legal) and unauthorized (illegal) sources but documentation on utilization practices and quality of circulating products is scanty. This study looked at the practices of trypanocidal drug utilization by farmers and the integrity of active ingredient in trypanocides sold in Gurage zone, south western Ethiopia. The surveys were based on a structured questionnaire and drug quality determination of commonly used brands originating from European and Asian companies and sold at both authorized and unauthorized markets. One hundred farmers were interviewed and 50 drug samples were collected in 2013 (Diminazene aceturate = 33 and Isometamidium chloride = 17; 25 from authorized and 25 from unauthorized sources). Samples were tested at the OIE-certified Veterinary Drug Control Laboratory (LACOMEV) in Dakar, Senegal, by using galenic standards and high performance liquid chromatography. RESULTS Trypanosomosis was found to be a major threat according to all interviewed livestock keepers in the study area. Diminazene aceturate and isometamidium chloride were preferred by 79{\%} and 21{\%} of the respondents respectively, and 85{\%} of them indicated that an animal receives more than six treatments per year. About 60{\%} of these treatments were reported to be administered by untrained farmers. Trypanocidal drug sources included both unauthorized outlets (56{\%}) and authorized government and private sources (44{\%}). A wide availability and usage of substandard quality drugs was revealed. Twenty eight percent of trypanocidal drugs tested failed to comply with quality requirements. There was no significant difference in the frequency of non-compliance between diminazene-based and isometamidium chloride products (P = 0.87) irrespective of the marketing channel (official and unofficial). However, higher rates of non-compliant trypanocides were detected for drugs originating from Asia than from Europe (P = 0.029). CONCLUSION The findings revealed the presence of risk factors for the development of drug resistance, i.e. wide distribution of poor quality drugs as well as substandard administration practices. Therefore, it is strongly recommended to enforce regulatory measures for quality control of veterinary drugs, to expand and strengthen veterinary services and to undertake trypanocidal drug efficacy studies of wider coverage.},

The biggest daily catches were obtained from the electric net and the unaccompanied trap, but while for G. m. morsitans the ratio of the catches from these two methods was 7:1, for G. pallidipes it was 0.7:1. Evening catches were 1.3-5.5 and 2.9-18.8 times higher than morning catches for the two species, respectively; the differences were greater for stationary than for mobile baits. The sample age structures differed signficantly (P {\textless} 0.05: X2) between methods in six of the ten possible contrasts between pairs of methods in G. m. morsitans and for all ten in G. pallidipes. The differences in age distribution and mean catch levels are attributed to increases in flight activity with age; at each age G. pallidipes is more active than G. m. morsitans. Man's presence in the trapping system reduced catches significantly (P {\textless} 0.05: t test) but this effect was small in the youngest and oldest flies. Odour-baited traps are biased in favour of G. pallidipes and, for both species, in favour of older flies; mortalities calculated from age distributions of trap samples therefore underestimate the true value.},

HAT is usually fatal if untreated and transmission occurs in foci across sub-Saharan Africa. Mathematical modelling of HAT began in the 1980s with extensions of the Ross-Macdonald malaria model and has since consisted, with a few exceptions, of similar deterministic compartmental models. These models have captured the main features of HAT epidemiology and provided insight on the effectiveness of the two main control interventions (treatment of humans and tsetse fly control) in eliminating transmission. However, most existing models have overestimated prevalence of infection and ignored transient dynamics. There is a need for properly validated models, evolving with improved data collection, that can provide quantitative predictions to help guide control and elimination strategies for HAT.},

abstract = {Sleeping sickness describes two diseases, both fatal if left untreated: (i) Gambian sleeping sickness caused by Trypanosoma brucei gambiense, a chronic disease with average infection lasting around 3 years, and (ii) Rhodesian sleeping sickness caused by T. b. rhodesiense, an acute disease with death occurring within weeks of infection. Control of Gambian sleeping sickness is based on case detection and treatment involving serological screening, followed by diagnostic confirmation and staging. In stage I, patients can remain asymptomatic as trypanosomes multiply in tissues and body fluids; in stage II, trypanosomes cross the blood-brain barrier, enter the central nervous system and, if left untreated, death follows. Staging is crucial as it defines the treatment that is prescribed; for both forms of disease, stage II involves the use of the highly toxic drug melarsoprol or, in the case of Gambian sleeping sickness, the use of complex and very expensive drug regimes. Case detection of T. b. gambiense sleeping sickness is known to be inefficient but could be improved by the identification of parasites using molecular tools that are, as yet, rarely used in the field. Diagnostics are not such a problem in relation to T. b. rhodesiense sleeping sickness, but the high level of under-reporting of this disease suggests that current strategies, reliant on self-reporting, are inefficient.Sleeping sickness is one of the 'neglected tropical diseases' that attracts little attention from donors or policymakers. Proper quantification of the burden of sleeping sickness matters, as the primary reason for its 'neglect' is that the true impact of the disease is unknown, largely as a result of under-reporting. Certainly, elimination will not be achieved without vast improvements in field diagnostics for both forms of sleeping sickness especially if there is a hidden reservoir of 'chronic carriers'. Mass screening would be a desirable aim for Gambian sleeping sickness and could be handled on a national scale in the endemic countries - perhaps by piggybacking on programmes committed to other diseases. As well as improved diagnostics, the search for non-toxic drugs for stage II treatment should remain a research priority.There is good evidence that thorough active case finding is sufficient to control T. b. gambiense sleeping sickness, as there is no significant animal reservoir. Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense sleeping sickness is a zoonosis and control involves interrupting the fly-animal-human cycle, so some form of tsetse control and chemotherapy of the animal reservoir must be involved. The restricted application of insecticide to cattle is the most promising, affordable and sustainable technique to have emerged for tsetse control. Animal health providers can aid disease control by treating cattle and, when allied with innovative methods of funding (e.g. public-private partnerships) not reliant on the public purse, this approach may prove more sustainable.Sleeping sickness incidence for the 36 endemic countries has shown a steady decline in recent years and we should take advantage of the apparent lull in incidence and aim for elimination. This is feasible in some sleeping sickness foci but must be planned and paid for increasingly by the endemic countries themselves. The control and elimination of T. b. gambiense sleeping sickness may be seen as a public good, as appropriate strategies depend on local health services for surveillance and treatment, but public-private funding mechanisms should not be excluded. It is timely to take up the tools available and invest in new tools - including novel financial instruments - to eliminate this disease from Africa. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Over the past 2 years, increased focus on statistical analysis brought on by the era of big data has pushed the issue of reproducibility out of the pages of academic journals and into the popular consciousness (1). Just weeks ago, a paper about the relationship between tissue-specific cancer incidence and stem cell divisions (2) was widely misreported because of misunderstandings about the primary statistical argument in the paper (3). Public pressure has contributed to the massive recent adoption of reproducible research tools, with corresponding improvements in reproducibility. But an analysis can be fully reproducible and still be wrong. Even the most spectacularly irreproducible analyses—like those underlying the ongoing lawsuits (4) over failed genomic signatures for chemotherapy assignment (5)—are ultimately reproducible (6). Once an analysis is reproducible, the key question we want to answer is, “Is this data analysis correct?” We have found that the most frequent failure in data analysis is mistaking the type of question being considered.},

The chapter reviews the evidence critically and assesses the alternative hypotheses. For animals, plants, protists and bacteria, the ecological importance of organism size is demonstrated by its effects on longevity, fecundity, metabolic rates, ability to migrate, competitive, predatory and anti-predator abilities, and ability to withstand starvation and desiccation. Metabolic rates, rates of gaseous exchange, risks of desiccation in terrestrial habitats or oxygen shortage in aquatic habitats are all affected by both temperature and size. Knowledge of how and why temperature influences size-at-stage in so many species, help provide a universal biological basis for the production of predictive quantitative models of size-at-stage, especially and perhaps first of all in aquaculture, agriculture, and other closely controlled environments in which energy and nutrients are not usually limiting. Wide-ranging ecological importance of organism size, and the variability in both weather and climate, knowledge of this biological rule, and possible law, also proves valuable to ecologists in many different fields.},

abstract = {We evaluate the cost-of-reproduction hypothesis in the burying beetle Nicrophorus orbicollis and examine how the importance of this trade-off changes as females age (i.e., the terminal-investment hypothesis). These beetles breed on small vertebrate carcasses, which serve as a food resource for them and their offspring. Consistent with the cost-of-reproduction hypothesis, females manipulated to overproduce offspring suffered a reduction in fecundity and life span when compared to controls, although all reproducing females had reduced life spans compared to nonbreeding females. Older females produced larger broods and allocated less of the carcass to their own body mass and a greater proportion to offspring than did younger females. Resource allocation to offspring increased with age. Females given larger carcasses invested more in current reproduction and less in future reproduction than did females given smaller carcasses. Our results provide unconfounded support for both the cost-of-reproduction hypothesis (i.e., current reproduction constrains future reproductive output) and the terminal-investment hypothesis (i.e., the importance of the trade-off between current and future reproduction declines with age such that allocation to current reproduction should increase as females age).},

@article{Overdulve1970e,
abstract = {In a discussion of the method of the ID63it is argued that three important objections against this method can be made: 1. 1. The mathematical presentation of this method (Lumsden et al. 1963), does not take into account that the theoretical straight line between lexit and log dilution has a fixed slope. Therefore, this method is only useful in those titrations in which the experimentally found slope of the (i,L) straight line does not differ widely from this fixed theoretical slope. A statistically more justified method for the calculation of the ID63from the experimental data is proposed, and a simplified method for a rough estimation of the ID63is given. It is advised that, in suitable cases, only dilutions in the vicinity of this roughly estimated ID63point should be used with a smaller dilution factor and larger groups of mice than in the work of Lumsden et al. (1963). 2. 2. The estimation of the ID63is always based on data obtained from infections in which very few or one single organism gives a positive result. In these infections statistical errors or biological variance, e.g., due to antibody formation (especially when the method is applied to parasites with a longer prepatent period than the trypanosomes used by Lumsden et al.), may have a great influence on the result. 3. 3. It is inherent in the method of the ID63that at least half of the number of mice used do not contribute substantially to the result. From an economic point of view this is an unsatisfying condition. The mathematical argument is given for the formula t = bi + a, where t = survival time (or prepatent period) and i = serial number of dilution (= log dilution changed to positive). In this formula the slope b is a measure of the rate of multiplication in vivo of the parasite and the constant a is a measure of the relative number of infective parasites in the original parasite suspension. This formula has the advantage that it is suitable for titrations in which all animals are infected with many parasites. The possibilities and difficulties of both methods are discussed and compared. {\textcopyright} 1970.},

@article{Benoit2014,
abstract = {Tsetse flies (Glossina spp.), vectors of African trypanosomes, are distinguished by their specialized reproductive biology, defined by adenotrophic viviparity (maternal nourishment of progeny by glandular secretions and live birth). This trait has evolved infrequently among insects and requires unique reproductive mechanisms. A key event in Glossina reproduction involves the transition between periods of lactation and nonlactation (dry periods). Increased lipolysis, nutrient transfer to the milk gland, and milk-specific protein production characterize lactation, which terminates at the birth of the progeny and is followed by a period of involution. The dry stage coincides with embryogenesis of the progeny, during which lipid reserves accumulate in preparation for the next round of lactation. The obligate bacterial symbiont Wigglesworthia glossinidia is critical to tsetse reproduction and likely provides B vitamins required for metabolic processes underlying lactation and/or progeny development. Here we describe findings that utilized transcriptomics, physiological assays, and RNA interference-based functional analysis to understand different components of adenotrophic viviparity in tsetse flies.

The model population was age-structured and density-dependent. If spray mortality is 100{\%} for each spray, then the ideal spraying schedule is easily determined from the durations of the various life stages. For spray mortality of less than 100{\%}, a simulation was used to determine optimal spraying schedules. Relative length of the larval period, fertility rate and age to first oviposition were found to be the most important biotic parameters for this determination. Their importance is magnified as spray mortality decreases. The stage targeted by sprays and the percent mortality caused by each spray are also important in determining the required number of sprays. Using medfly (Ceratitis capitata Wiedmann) biotic parameters as an example when the spray targets adults, it appeared that neither the stage at which density-dependent mortality takes effect, nor the form of the adult survivorship curve are important in determining the optimal spray schedule.},

Farmers in the test group received an information leaflet designed to address gaps in farmer knowledge likely to lead to inadequate treatment; their knowledge was assessed before the intervention, and at 2 weeks and 5 months after the intervention. We assessed the quality of farmer treatments by measuring clinical outcomes in cattle 2 weeks after selection and treatment. As an indicator of herd health, we assessed the mean hematocrit of the village herd before, and 5 months after, the intervention. To account for clustering, we analysed data using generalised estimating equations. Improvements in farmer knowledge of trypanosomosis diagnosis and treatment at 2 weeks and 5 months in the group receiving information were 23{\%} and 14{\%} greater at 2 weeks and 5 months, respectively. In the test group, 84{\%} of farmer treatments were successful, compared to 73{\%} in the control group.

The model included density-independent and -dependent mortality rates, temperature-dependent mortality, an age-dependent mortality, two mechanisms of dispersal and a component of aggregation. Sensitivity analyses assessed the importance of various life history features and indicated that female fertility and factors affecting survivorship had the greatest impact on the equilibrium of the female population. The female equilibrium was likewise reduced when dispersal and aggregation were acting together. Sensitivity analyses showed that basic female survivorship, age-dependent and temperature-dependent survivorship of adults, teneral-specific survivorship, daily female fertility, and mean temperature had the greatest effect on the four applied control measures. Time to eradication was reduced by initial knockdown of the population and due to the synergism of certain combinations of methods [e. g., traps-targets and sterile insect technique (SIT); ITL and SIT]. Competitive ability of the sterile males was an important parameter when sterile to wild male overflooding ratios were small. An aggregated wild population reduced the efficiency of the SIT, but increased it with increased dispersal. The model can be used interactively to facilitate decision making during the planning and implementation of operational area-wide integrated pest management programs against tsetse. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Society of Population Ecology and Springer.},

abstract = {We used analytic and simulation models to determine the ecological conditions favoring evolution of a matrotrophic fish from a lecithotrophic ancestor given a complex set of trade-offs. Matrotrophy is the nourishment of viviparous embryos by resources provided between fertilization and parturition, while lecithotrophy describes embryo nourishment provided before fertilization. In fishes and reptiles, embryo nourishment encompasses a continuum from solely lecithotrophic to primarily matrotrophic. Matrotrophy has evolved independently from lecithotrophic ancestors many times in many groups. We assumed matrotrophy increased the number of offspring a viviparous female could gestate and evaluated conditions of food availability favoring lecithotrophy or matrotrophy. The matrotrophic strategy was superior when food resources exceeded demand during gestation but at a risk of overproduction and reproductive failure if food intake was limited. Matrotrophic females were leaner during gestation than lecithotrophic females, yielding shorter life spans. Our models suggest that matrotrophic embryo nourishment evolved in environments with high food availability, consistently exceeding energy requirements for maintaining relatively large broods. Embryo abortion with some resorption of invested energy is a necessary preadaptation to the evolution of matrotrophy. Future work should explore trade-offs of age-specific mortality and reproductive output for females maintaining different levels of fat storage during gestation.},

abstract = {Trypanosomiasis control increasingly involves financial input from livestock owners and their active participation. If control is carried out on smaller scales than in the past, methods such as aerial and ground spraying and sterile insect techniques will have reduced application. There will be increased reliance on trypanocidal drugs, and bait methods of tsetse control - where flies are attracted to point sources and killed. If drug resistance develops, cheap and simple bait methods offer the only means of disease control that might be applied, and paid for, by stockowners themselves. The methods have been effective in some circumstances, but not in others, and it is important to understand the reasons for the successes and the failures. Analysis is presented of the results of two Tanzanian tsetse control campaigns involving the use of insecticide-treated cattle. Between 1991 and 1996, following the introduction of widespread dipping in the Kagera Region, trypanosomiasis declined from {\textgreater} 19 000 cases to {\textless} 2400 and deaths from {\textgreater} 1000 to 29. On four ranches in the region, tsetse have been almost eliminated and trypanosomiasis prophylaxis is no longer used. Similarly aggressive use of pyrethroids on Mkwaja Ranch in Tanga Region has not had such dramatic effects. Tsetse and trypanosomiasis are still common, despite high levels of prophylaxis and the deployment of ≃ 200 odour-baited targets. The difference in the results is attributed to a combination of the much smaller area covered by treated animals at Mkwaja, a greater susceptibility to re-invasion and a more suitable habitat for the flies. A better understanding of the dynamics of the use of insecticide-treated cattle is needed before we can predict confidently the outcome of particular control operations.},
