abstract = {The basic reproduction number and the point of endemic equilibrium are two very important factors in any deterministic compartmental epidemic model as the basic reproduction number and the point of endemic equilibrium represent the nature of disease transmission and disease prevalence respectively. In this article the sensitivity analysis based on mathematical as well as statistical techniques has been performed to determine the importance of the epidemic model parameters. It is observed that 6 out of the 11 input parameters play a prominent role in determining the magnitude of the basic reproduction number. It is shown that the basic reproduction number is the most sensitive to the transmission rate of disease. It is also shown that control of transmission rate and recovery rate of the clinically ill are crucial to stop the spreading of influenza epidemics. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Originally evolved in the 19th century from an attempt by Galton and Watson (earlier work of Bienaym has been found recently) to show how probability related to the extinction of family names, the theory of branching processes has become widely used as a theoretical basis for the study of populations of such objects as genes, neutrons, or cosmic rays. The present hardcover volume, originally sponsored by The RAND Corporation, was the first systematic and comprehensive treatment of a theory of mathematical models for the development of populations whose members reproduce and die, subject to laws of change. Beginning with the classical Galton-Watson model for the propagation of a family of objects all of one type, the author then extends the theory of objects of several types and to objects described by continuous variables. He next applies the theory to one of the simpler mathematical models for neutron chain reactions. Succeeding chapters treat Markov branching processes with a continuous time parameter and age-dependent branching processes. The last chapter gives the mathematical theory of electron-photo cascades, one of the components of cosmic radiation.

abstract = {In this study, we have simplified the Kirschner-Panetta model on the interaction of tumor cells and effector cells by considering linear growth term as opposed to logistic growth term used by Kirschner and Panetta. We have done a comprehensive mathematical analysis and established the existence of positive equilibrium. In addition, a fixed point bifurcation is investigated using the rate of spread of tumor as a varying parameter, suggesting that backward bifurcation can occur under reasonable choice of parameters. However, bistable dynamics is unlikely to happen in this case, which implies that the strategies that could reduce the rate of spread of tumor are the most influential to cancer treatment. Through mathematical deduction and numerical simulation, an elaborate uncertainty and sensitivity analysis of the rate of spread of tumor Rs{\$}R{\_}{\{}s{\}}{\$} is performed. The distribution of Rs{\$}R{\_}{\{}s{\}}{\$} is derived, and the sensitivity of the magnitude of Rs{\$}R{\_}{\{}s{\}}{\$} to the uncertainty in estimating values of input parameters is assessed. The results indicate that the external source of effector cells and its death rate are influential in the rate of spread of tumor.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Tsetse flies occur in much of sub-Saharan Africa where they are vectors of trypanosomes that cause human and animal African trypanosomosis. The sterile insect technique (SIT) is currently used to eliminate tsetse fly populations in an area-wide integrated pest management (AW-IPM) context in Senegal and Ethiopia. Three Glossina palpalis gambiensis strains [originating from Burkina Faso (BKF), Senegal (SEN) and an introgressed strain (SENbkf)] were established and are now available for use in future AW-IPM programmes against trypanosomes in West Africa. For each strain, knowledge of the environmental survival thresholds is essential to determine which of these strains is best suited to a particular environment or ecosystem, and can therefore be used effectively in SIT programmes. METHODS In this paper, we investigated the survival and fecundity of three G. p. gambiensis strains maintained under various conditions: 25 °C and 40, 50, 60, and 75 {\%} relative humidity (rH), 30 °C and 60 {\%} rH and 35 °C and 60 {\%} rH. RESULTS The survival of the three strains was dependent on temperature only, and it was unaffected by changing humidity within the tested range. The BKF strain survived temperatures above its optimum better than the SEN strain. The SENbkf showed intermediate resistance to high temperatures. A temperature of about 32 °C was the limit for survival for all strains. A rH ranging from 40 to 76 {\%} had no effect on fecundity at 25-26 °C. CONCLUSIONS We discuss the implications of these results on tsetse SIT-based control programmes.},

abstract = {We perform sensitivity analyses on a mathematical model of malaria transmission to determine the relative importance of model parameters to disease transmission and prevalence. We compile two sets of baseline parameter values: one for areas of high transmission and one for low transmission. We compute sensitivity indices of the reproductive number (which measures initial disease transmission) and the endemic equilibrium point (which measures disease prevalence) to the parameters at the baseline values. We find that in areas of low transmission, the reproductive number and the equilibrium proportion of infectious humans are most sensitive to the mosquito biting rate. In areas of high transmission, the reproductive number is again most sensitive to the mosquito biting rate, but the equilibrium proportion of infectious humans is most sensitive to the human recovery rate. This suggests strategies that target the mosquito biting rate (such as the use of insecticide-treated bed nets and indoor residual spraying) and those that target the human recovery rate (such as the prompt diagnosis and treatment of infectious individuals) can be successful in controlling malaria.},

@article{Hargrove2005a,
abstract = {A stochastic branching process was used to derive equations for the mean and variance of the probability of, and time to, extinction in tsetse populations. If the remnant population is a single inseminated female, the extinction probability increases linearly with adult mortality and is always certain if this mortality {\textgreater}3.5{\%} per day even for zero pupal mortality. If the latter mortality is 4{\%} per day, certain extinction is only avoided if adult mortality {\textless}1.5{\%} per day. For remnant female populations {\textgreater}1, the extinction probability increases in a non-linear manner with adult mortality. Extinction is still certain for adult mortality {\textgreater}3.5{\%} per day but, when the remnant population is {\textgreater}16, extinction is highly unlikely for adult mortality {\textless}2.5{\%} per day if all females are inseminated. Extinction probability increases with increasing probability of sterile mating in much the same way as it does with increasing adult mortality. Extinction is assured if the probability of insemination can be reduced to 0.1. The required reduction decreases with increasing adult mortality. For adult mortality = 6-8{\%} per day, the time to extinction increases only by one generation per order of magnitude increase in the starting population. Time to extinction is less sensitive to changes in the pupal than in the adult mortality. Reductions in the probability of insemination only become important when adult mortality is small; if the adult mortality is 8{\%} per day, reducing the insemination probability from 1 to 0.1 only reduces the expected time to extinction by two generations. Conversely, increases in adult mortality produce important reductions in the required time even when the probability of insemination is 0.1. The practical, economic implication for the sterile insect technique is that the low-tech methods used to suppress tsetse populations should not be halted when the release of sterile males is initiated. The sterile insect technique should only be contemplated when it has been demonstrated that the low-tech methods have failed to effect eradication. The theory is shown to be in good accord with the observed results of tsetse control campaigns involving the use of odourbaited targets in Zimbabwe and the sterile insect technique on Unguja Island, Zanzibar.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Ackley, Hargrove. Human and animal trypanosomiasis, spread by tsetse flies (Glossina spp), is a major public health concern in much of sub-Saharan Africa. The basic reproduction number of vector-borne diseases, such as trypanosomiasis, is a function of vector mortality rate. Robust methods for estimating tsetse mortality are thus of interest for understanding population and disease dynamics and for optimal control. Existing methods for estimating mortality in adult tsetse, from ovarian dissection data, often use invalid assumptions of the existence of a stable age distribution, and age-invariant mortality and capture probability. We develop a dynamic model to estimate tsetse mortality from ovarian dissection data in populations where the age distribution is not necessarily stable. The models correspond to several hypotheses about how temperature affects mortality: no temperature dependence (model 1), identical temperature dependence for mature adults and immature stages, i.e., pupae and newly emerged adults (model 2), and differential temperature dependence for mature adults and immature stages (model 3). We fit our models to ovarian dissection data for G. pallidipes collected at Rekomitjie Research Station in the Zambezi Valley in Zimbabwe. We compare model fits to determine the most probable model, given the data, by calculating the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) for each model. The model that allows for a differential dependence of temperature on mortality for immature stages and mature adults (model 3) performs significantly better than models 1 and 2. All models produce mortality estimates, for mature adults, of approximately 3{\%} per day for mean daily temperatures below 25°C, consistent with those of mark-recapture studies performed in other settings. For temperatures greater than 25°C, mortality among immature classes of tsetse increases substantially, whereas mortality remains roughly constant for mature adults. As a sensitivity analysis, model 3 was simultaneously fit to both the ovarian dissection and trap data; while this fit also produces comparable mortality at temperatures below 25°C, it is not possible to obtain good fits to both data sources simultaneously, highlighting the uncertain correspondence between trap catches and population levels and/or the need for further improvements to our model. The modelling approach employed here could be applied to any substantial time series of age distribution data.},

abstract = {Decision-making and financial planning for tsetse control is complex, with a particularly wide range of choices to be made on location, timing, strategy and methods. This paper presents full cost estimates for eliminating or continuously controlling tsetse in a hypothetical area of 10,000km2 located in south-eastern Uganda. Four tsetse control techniques were analysed: (i) artificial baits (insecticide-treated traps/targets), (ii) insecticide-treated cattle (ITC), (iii) aerial spraying using the sequential aerosol technique (SAT) and (iv) the addition of the sterile insect technique (SIT) to the insecticide-based methods (i-iii).For the creation of fly-free zones and using a 10{\%} discount rate, the field costs per km2 came to US{\$}283 for traps (4 traps per km2), US{\$}30 for ITC (5 treated cattle per km2 using restricted application), US{\$}380 for SAT and US{\$}758 for adding SIT. The inclusion of entomological and other preliminary studies plus administrative overheads adds substantially to the overall cost, so that the total costs become US{\$}482 for traps, US{\$}220 for ITC, US{\$}552 for SAT and US{\$}993 - 1365 if SIT is added following suppression using another method. These basic costs would apply to trouble-free operations dealing with isolated tsetse populations. Estimates were also made for non-isolated populations, allowing for a barrier covering 10{\%} of the intervention area, maintained for 3 years. Where traps were used as a barrier, the total cost of elimination increased by between 29{\%} and 57{\%} and for ITC barriers the increase was between 12{\%} and 30{\%}.In the case of continuous tsetse control operations, costs were estimated over a 20-year period and discounted at 10{\%}. Total costs per km2 came to US{\$}368 for ITC, US{\$}2114 for traps, all deployed continuously, and US{\$}2442 for SAT applied at 3-year intervals. The lower costs compared favourably with the regular treatment of cattle with prophylactic trypanocides (US{\$}3862 per km2 assuming four doses per annum at 45 cattle per km2).Throughout the study, sensitivity analyses were conducted to explore the impact on cost estimates of different densities of ITC and traps, costs of baseline studies and discount rates. The present analysis highlights the cost differentials between the different intervention techniques, whilst attesting to the significant progress made over the years in reducing field costs. Results indicate that continuous control activities can be cost-effective in reducing tsetse populations, especially where the creation of fly-free zones is challenging and reinvasion pressure high. {\textcopyright} 2013 Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.},

abstract = {Background: African trypanosomiasis, also known as "sleeping sickness" in humans and "nagana" in livestock is an important vector-borne disease in Sub-Saharan Africa. Control of trypanosomiasis has focused on eliminating the vector, the tsetse fly (. Glossina, spp.). Effective tsetse fly control planning requires models to predict tsetse population and distribution changes over time and space. Traditional planning models have used statistical tools to predict tsetse distributions and have been hindered by limited field survey data. Methodology/results: We developed an Agent-Based Model (ABM) to provide timing and location information for tsetse fly control without presence/absence training data. The model is driven by daily remotely-sensed environment data. The model provides a flexible tool linking environmental changes with individual biology to analyze tsetse control methods such as aerial insecticide spraying, wild animal control, releasing irradiated sterile tsetse males, and land use and cover modification. Significance: This is a bottom-up process-based model with freely available data as inputs that can be easily transferred to a new area. The tsetse population simulation more closely approximates real conditions than those using traditional statistical models making it a useful tool in tsetse fly control planning.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: To evaluate the relative effectiveness of tsetse control methods, their costs need to be analysed alongside their impact on tsetse populations. Very little has been published on the costs of methods specifically targeting human African trypanosomiasis.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In northern Uganda, a 250 km2 field trial was undertaken using small (0.5 X 0.25 m) insecticide-treated targets ("tiny targets"). Detailed cost recording accompanied every phase of the work. Costs were calculated for this operation as if managed by the Ugandan vector control services: removing purely research components of the work and applying local salaries. This calculation assumed that all resources are fully used, with no spare capacity. The full cost of the operation was assessed at USD 85.4 per km2, of which USD 55.7 or 65.2{\%} were field costs, made up of three component activities (target deployment: 34.5{\%}, trap monitoring: 10.6{\%} and target maintenance: 20.1{\%}). The remaining USD 29.7 or 34.8{\%} of the costs were for preliminary studies and administration (tsetse surveys: 6.0{\%}, sensitisation of local populations: 18.6{\%} and office support: 10.2{\%}). Targets accounted for only 12.9{\%} of the total cost, other important cost components were labour (24.1{\%}) and transport (34.6{\%}).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nDISCUSSION: Comparison with the updated cost of historical HAT vector control projects and recent estimates indicates that this work represents a major reduction in cost levels. This is attributed not just to the low unit cost of tiny targets but also to the organisation of delivery, using local labour with bicycles or motorcycles. Sensitivity analyses were undertaken, investigating key prices and assumptions. It is believed that these costs are generalizable to other HAT foci, although in more remote areas, with denser vegetation and fewer people, costs would increase, as would be the case for other tsetse control techniques.},

abstract = {Mosquito-borne diseases are causing a substantial burden of mortality, morbidity and economic loss in many parts of the world, despite current control efforts, and new complementary approaches to controlling these diseases are needed. One promising class of new interventions under development involves the heritable modification of the mosquito by insertion of novel genes into the nucleus or of Wolbachia endosymbionts into the cytoplasm. Once released into a target population, these modifications can act to reduce one or more components of the mosquito population's vectorial capacity (e.g. the number of female mosquitoes, their longevity or their ability to support development and transmission of the pathogen). Some of the modifications under development are designed to be self-limiting, in that they will tend to disappear over time in the absence of recurrent releases (and hence are similar to the sterile insect technique, SIT), whereas other modifications are designed to be self-sustaining, spreading through populations even after releases stop (and hence are similar to traditional biological control). Several successful field trials have now been performed with Aedes mosquitoes, and such trials are helping to define the appropriate developmental pathway for this new class of intervention. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Authors.},

abstract = {The effectiveness of odour-baited targets treated with 0.8{\%} deltamethrin in controlling Glossina austeni Newstead and G. brevipalpis Newstead (Diptera: Glossinidae) was evaluated in Zululand, South Africa. Targets were initially deployed in the three habitat types (grassland, woodland and forest) of two adjacent areas at a density of four targets per km(2). One area functioned as the treatment block (c. 35 km(2)) and included the focus of the target deployment, and the second area functioned as a barrier block (c. 40 km(2)) against tsetse fly re-invasion from the untreated area to the south. After 8 months, targets were removed from open grassland in both areas and target density in wooded habitats and sand forest was increased to eight per km(2). Twelve months later, all targets were removed from the barrier block and used to increase target density in the wooded and sand forest habitats of the treatment block to 12 per km(2). This target density was maintained for 14 months. In the treatment area, a 99{\%} reduction in G. austeni females occurred after 13 months at a target density of eight per km(2) in wooded habitat; this was maintained for 22 months. Reduction in G. brevipalpis was less marked. The relatively poor reduction in G. brevipalpis is attributed to the high mobility of this species and its distribution throughout less wooded and more open habitats.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 Matsuyama et al. Background: A Rohingya refugee camp in Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh experienced a large-scale diphtheria epidemic in 2017. The background information of previously immune fraction among refugees cannot be explicitly estimated, and thus we conducted an uncertainty analysis of the basic reproduction number, R 0 . Methods: A renewal process model was devised to estimate the R 0 and ascertainment rate of cases, and loss of susceptible individuals was modeled as one minus the sum of initially immune fraction and the fraction naturally infected during the epidemic. To account for the uncertainty of initially immune fraction, we employed a Latin Hypercube sampling (LHS) method. Results: R 0 ranged from 4.7 to 14.8 with the median estimate at 7.2. R 0 was positively correlated with ascertainment rates. Sensitivity analysis indicated that R 0 would become smaller with greater variance of the generation time. Discussion: Estimated R 0 was broadly consistent with published estimate from endemic data, indicating that the vaccination coverage of 86{\%} has to be satisfied to prevent the epidemic by means of mass vaccination. LHS was particularly useful in the setting of a refugee camp in which the background health status is poorly quantified.},
