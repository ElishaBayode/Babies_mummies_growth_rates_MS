abstract = {Originally evolved in the 19th century from an attempt by Galton and Watson (earlier work of Bienaym has been found recently) to show how probability related to the extinction of family names, the theory of branching processes has become widely used as a theoretical basis for the study of populations of such objects as genes, neutrons, or cosmic rays. The present hardcover volume, originally sponsored by The RAND Corporation, was the first systematic and comprehensive treatment of a theory of mathematical models for the development of populations whose members reproduce and die, subject to laws of change. Beginning with the classical Galton-Watson model for the propagation of a family of objects all of one type, the author then extends the theory of objects of several types and to objects described by continuous variables. He next applies the theory to one of the simpler mathematical models for neutron chain reactions. Succeeding chapters treat Markov branching processes with a continuous time parameter and age-dependent branching processes. The last chapter gives the mathematical theory of electron-photo cascades, one of the components of cosmic radiation. Unabridged, corrected Dover republication of the edition co-published by Springer-Verlag, Berlin, and Prentice-Hall, Inc., Englewood Cliffs, N.J., 1963. Prefaces. Appendixes. Bibliography.

abstract = {Tsetse exhibit a U-shaped age-mortality curve, with high losses after eclosion and a well-marked ageing process, which is particularly dramatic in males. A three-parameter (k(1) -k(3) ) model for age-dependent adult instantaneous mortality rates was constructed using mark-recapture data for the tsetse fly Glossina morsitans morsitans Westwood (Diptera: Glossinidae). Mortality changed linearly with k(1) over all ages; k(2) affected only losses in roughly the first week of adult life, and k(3) controlled the ageing rate. Mortality pooled over age was twice as sensitive to changes in k(3) as in k(1) . Population growth rate was, however, similarly affected by these two parameters, reflecting the disproportionate effect of k(3) on mortality in the oldest flies that contribute least to the growth rate. Pooled-age mortality and growth rate were insensitive to changes in k(2) . The same model also provided good fits to data for laboratory colonies of female G. m. morsitans and Glossina austeni Newstead and should be applicable to all tsetse of both sexes. The new model for tsetse mortality should be incorporated into models of tsetse and trypanosome population dynamics; it will also inform the estimation of adult female mortality from ovarian dissection data.},

abstract = {Trypanosomiasis control increasingly involves financial input from livestock owners and their active participation. If control is carried out on smaller scales than in the past, methods such as aerial and ground spraying and sterile insect techniques will have reduced application. There will be increased reliance on trypanocidal drugs, and bait methods of tsetse control - where flies are attracted to point sources and killed. If drug resistance develops, cheap and simple bait methods offer the only means of disease control that might be applied, and paid for, by stockowners themselves. The methods have been effective in some circumstances, but not in others, and it is important to understand the reasons for the successes and the failures. Analysis is presented of the results of two Tanzanian tsetse control campaigns involving the use of insecticide-treated cattle. Between 1991 and 1996, following the introduction of widespread dipping in the Kagera Region, trypanosomiasis declined from  {\textgreater}  19 000 cases to  {\textless}  2400 and deaths from  {\textgreater}  1000 to 29. On four ranches in the region, tsetse have been almost eliminated and trypanosomiasis prophylaxis is no longer used. Similarly aggressive use of pyrethroids on Mkwaja Ranch in Tanga Region has not had such dramatic effects. Tsetse and trypanosomiasis are still common, despite high levels of prophylaxis and the deployment of ≃ 200 odour-baited targets. The difference in the results is attributed to a combination of the much smaller area covered by treated animals at Mkwaja, a greater susceptibility to re-invasion and a more suitable habitat for the flies. A better understanding of the dynamics of the use of insecticide-treated cattle is needed before we can predict confidently the outcome of particular control operations.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Small targets comprising panels of blue and insecticide-treated black netting material each 0.25 × 0.25 m have been shown to attract and kill Glossina fuscipes fuscipes Newstead, 1910 (Diptera: Glossinidae) thereby reducing its population density by over 90{\%} in field trials. However, their attractive ability has not been fully exploited for sampling purposes. Therefore, in this study we assessed the effectiveness of using sticky small targets as sampling tools for G. f. fuscipes in western Kenya. We also determined the influence of colour on the landing response of female and male flies on sticky small targets.
METHODS: Using a series of randomised block experiments, the numbers of tsetse flies caught with sticky small targets were compared with those caught with biconical traps. A negative binomial regression was used to model fly catches. Odds ratios as measures of association between the landing response on the blue or black panel of the sticky small target and the sex of flies were obtained from a multiple logistic regression.
RESULTS: The results showed that sticky small targets caught 13.5 and 3.6 times more female and male tsetse flies than biconical traps (Z = 9.551, P {\textless} 0.0001 and Z = 5.978, P {\textless} 0.0001, respectively). Females had a 1.7 times likelihood of landing on the black panel than males (Z = 2.25, P = 0.025).
CONCLUSION: This study suggests that sticky small targets are an effective sampling tool for G. f. fuscipes. Therefore, we recommend the use of sticky small targets as an alternative to biconical traps for observational and experimental investigations of G. f. fuscipes.},

abstract = {A density-dependent model is used to describe the dynamics of an open population of tsetse flies (Diptera: Glossinidae). Immigration (or emigration) takes place when the total population is below (or above) a biologically determined threshold value. The population is also subjected to birth and death rates, as well as to the risk of being trapped (continuously or intermittently). During trapping the population decreases toward a 'low' equilibrium population and when trapping ceases the population starts recovering and increases toward a 'high' equilibrium. The model is fitted using data collected on trapped flies in four experiments. The first one was conducted with 'intermittent trapping' (i.e. several trapping-recovery cycles) on Glossina fuscipes fuscipes Newstead in the Central African Republic (Bangui area). In the other experiments, trapping data on Glossina palpalis palpalis (Robineau-Desvoidy) was collected in 'aggregate' form over several days at a time. Two of these were in Congo-Brazzaville (Bouenza area) and one in the Ivory Coast (Vavoua focus). Estimates are derived for the low and high equilibrium values as well as the trapping rate. The estimated effect of sustained trapping is to reduce the population to low equilibrium values that are 85-87{\%} lower than the levels without trapping. The effects of the natural intrinsic growth and of the migration flows cannot be estimated separately because in the model they are mathematically indistinguishable.},

abstract = {Understanding the nature and relative importance of endogenous (density- dependent) and exogenous (density-independent) effects on population dynamics remains a central problem in ecology. Evaluation of these forces has been constrained by the lack of long time series of population densities and largely limited to populations chosen for their unique dynamics (e.g., outbreak insects). Especially in herbivore populations, the relative contributions of bottom-up and top-down effects (resources and natural enemies, respectively) have been difficult to compare because population data have rarely been combined with resource measurements. The feeding scars of a wood-mining herbivorous insect (Phytobia betulae Kangas; Diptera: Agromyzidae) of birch trees (Betula pendula and Betula pubescens) provided long time series data (47 and 65 years) of absolute abundance (larvae/tree) in replicated trees within replicated stands. Measurements of tree annual rings provided matching time series of host age and physiological status. Analyses showed a powerful exogenous effect of stand age on temporal variation in insect abundance (58 and 32{\%} of the variance in two populations, respectively). With the additional effects of variation among trees, 77 and 64{\%} of the total variance in abundance was attributable to exogenous bottom- up effects of host plants. Potential endogenous effects were evident as immediate linear density dependence, but only accounted for ≃ 10{\%} of the total variance. Abundance of Phytobia is primarily a function of disturbance history, which produces a mosaic of different aged birch stands that harbor Phytobia populations of different sizes. Density-dependence tends to regulate local populations around levels determined by host suitability.},

abstract = {Environmental temperature is an important driver of the population dynamics of tsetse ( Glossina spp) because the fly's immature stages are particularly vulnerable to temperatures ( T ) outside the range T = 16–32°C. Laboratory experiments carried out 50 years ago provide extensive measures of temperature-dependent rates of development, fat consumption and mortality in tsetse pupae. We improve on the models originally fitted to these data, providing better parameter estimates for use in population modelling. A composite function accurately models rates of pupal development for T = 8–32°C. Pupal duration can be estimated by summing the temperature-dependent daily percentage of development completed. Fat consumption is modelled as a logistic function of temperature; the total fat consumed during pupal development takes a minimum for T ≈ 25°C. Pupae experiencing constant temperatures {\textless}16°C exhaust their fat reserves before they complete development. At high temperatures, direct effects kill the pupae before fat stores are exhausted. The relationship between pupal mortality and temperature is well described by the sum of two exponential functions. Summing daily mortality rates over the whole pupal period does not reliably predict overall mortality. Mortality is more strongly correlated with the mean temperature experienced over pupal life or, for T ≤ 30°C, the fat consumption during this period. The new results will be particularly useful in the construction of various models for tsetse population dynamics, and will have particular relevance for agent-based models where the lives of individual tsetse are simulated using a daily time step.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Tsetse flies occur in much of sub-Saharan Africa where they are vectors of trypanosomes that cause human and animal African trypanosomosis. The sterile insect technique (SIT) is currently used to eliminate tsetse fly populations in an area-wide integrated pest management (AW-IPM) context in Senegal and Ethiopia. Three Glossina palpalis gambiensis strains [originating from Burkina Faso (BKF), Senegal (SEN) and an introgressed strain (SENbkf)] were established and are now available for use in future AW-IPM programmes against trypanosomes in West Africa. For each strain, knowledge of the environmental survival thresholds is essential to determine which of these strains is best suited to a particular environment or ecosystem, and can therefore be used effectively in SIT programmes. METHODS In this paper, we investigated the survival and fecundity of three G. p. gambiensis strains maintained under various conditions: 25 °C and 40, 50, 60, and 75 {\%} relative humidity (rH), 30 °C and 60 {\%} rH and 35 °C and 60 {\%} rH. RESULTS The survival of the three strains was dependent on temperature only, and it was unaffected by changing humidity within the tested range. The BKF strain survived temperatures above its optimum better than the SEN strain. The SENbkf showed intermediate resistance to high temperatures. A temperature of about 32 °C was the limit for survival for all strains. A rH ranging from 40 to 76 {\%} had no effect on fecundity at 25-26 °C. CONCLUSIONS We discuss the implications of these results on tsetse SIT-based control programmes.},

abstract = {Seventy-eight species of edible insects, representing twenty-three families from the state of Oaxaca in Mexico, were analyzed for nutrient composition. They include the orders of Anoplura, Diptera, Orthoptera, Hemiptera, Homoptera, Lepidoptera, Coleoptera, and Hymenoptera. The dry basis protein content ranged from 15 to 81{\%}. The highest was found in a wasp of the genus Polybia. Fat content ranged from 4.2{\%} (several grasshopper species: Boopedon flaviventris, Sphenarium sp., Melanoplus mexicanus ) to 77.2{\%} in the larvae of a butterfly Phasus triangularis. The insect richest in carbohydrates was the ant Myrmecosistus melliger with 77.7{\%}. The amino acid profile of the studied insects compares with the preschooler and adult requirements indicated in 1985 by the F.A.O. and the W.H.O. Their protein chemical score (corresponding to the capacity for fulfilling the requirement of the most limiting essential amino acid) ranged from 46 to 96{\%}; in a few cases there were deficiences of tryptophan and lysine. Protein digestibility varied between 76 and 98{\%} for the species analyzed. The caloric contribution varied from 293 to 762 kcal/100 g, the highest value also being for the butterfly larvae of Phasus triangularis. Constituting a significant component of the diet of some rural communities in Oaxaca, consump- tion parameters vary depending on the species, season, habitat, climate, and biotope. Eaten daily in some regions, insects are roasted, fried, or incorporated into a ragout dish, generally in the immature stage. Hymenoptera (ants, bees, and wasps) are preferred for consumption.},

abstract = {Background: It has been suggested that attempts to eradicate populations of tsetse (Glossina spp.) using stationary targets might fail because smaller, less mobile individuals are unlikely to be killed by the targets. If true, tsetse caught in stationary traps should be larger than those from mobile baits, which require less mobility on the part of the flies. Results: Sampling tsetse in the Zambezi Valley of Zimbabwe, we found that the number of tsetse caught from stationary traps, as a percent of total numbers from traps plus a mobile vehicle, was {\~{}}5{\%} for male G. morsitans morsitans (mean wing length 5.830 mm; 95{\%} CI: 5.800–5.859 mm) and {\~{}}10{\%} for females (6.334 mm; 95{\%} CI: 6.329– 6.338 mm); for G. pallidipes the figures were {\~{}}50{\%} for males (6.830 mm; 95{\%} CI: 6.821–6.838 mm) and {\~{}}75{\%} for females (7.303 mm, 95{\%} CI: 7.302–7.305 mm). As expected, flies of the smaller species (and the smaller sex) were less likely to be captured using stationary, rather than mobile sampling devices. For flies of a given sex and species the situation was more complex. Multivariable analysis showed that, for females of both species, wing lengths changed with ovarian age and the month, year and method of capture. For G. pallidipes, there were statistically significant interactions between ovarian age and capture month, year and method. For G. m. morsitans, there was only a significant interaction between ovarian age and capture month. The effect of capture method was, however, small in absolute terms: for G. pallidipes and G. m. morsitans flies caught on the mobile vehicle had wings only 0.24 and 0.48{\%} shorter, respectively, than flies caught in stationary traps. In summary, wing length in field samples of tsetse varies with ovarian age, capture month and year and, weakly, with capture method. Suggestions that a target-based operation against G. f. fuscipes in Kenya caused a shift towards a smaller, less mobile population of tsetse, unavailable to the targets, failed to account for factors other than capture method. Conclusions: The results are consistent with the successful use of targets to eradicate populations of tsetse in Zimbabwe. Until further, more nuanced, studies are conducted, it is premature to conclude that targets alone could not, similarly, be used to eradicate G. f. fuscipes populations in Kenya.},

abstract = {A stochastic branching process was used to derive equations for the mean and variance of the probability of, and time to, extinction in tsetse populations. If the remnant population is a single inseminated female, the extinction probability increases linearly with adult mortality and is always certain if this mortality {\textgreater}3.5{\%} per day even for zero pupal mortality. If the latter mortality is 4{\%} per day, certain extinction is only avoided if adult mortality {\textless}1.5{\%} per day. For remnant female populations {\textgreater}1, the extinction probability increases in a non-linear manner with adult mortality. Extinction is still certain for adult mortality {\textgreater}3.5{\%} per day but, when the remnant population is {\textgreater}16, extinction is highly unlikely for adult mortality {\textless}2.5{\%} per day if all females are inseminated. Extinction probability increases with increasing probability of sterile mating in much the same way as it does with increasing adult mortality. Extinction is assured if the probability of insemination can be reduced to 0.1. The required reduction decreases with increasing adult mortality. For adult mortality = 6-8{\%} per day, the time to extinction increases only by one generation per order of magnitude increase in the starting population. Time to extinction is less sensitive to changes in the pupal than in the adult mortality. Reductions in the probability of insemination only become important when adult mortality is small; if the adult mortality is 8{\%} per day, reducing the insemination probability from 1 to 0.1 only reduces the expected time to extinction by two generations. Conversely, increases in adult mortality produce important reductions in the required time even when the probability of insemination is 0.1. The practical, economic implication for the sterile insect technique is that the low-tech methods used to suppress tsetse populations should not be halted when the release of sterile males is initiated. The sterile insect technique should only be contemplated when it has been demonstrated that the low-tech methods have failed to effect eradication. The theory is shown to be in good accord with the observed results of tsetse control campaigns involving the use of odourbaited targets in Zimbabwe and the sterile insect technique on Unguja Island, Zanzibar.},

abstract = {Insect water balance plays an important role in determining energy budgets, activity patterns, survival, and population dynamics and, hence, geographic distribution. Tsetse (Glossina spp.) are important vectors of human and animal disease occupying a wide range of habitats in Africa and are notable for their desiccation resistance in xeric environments. Here, we measure water balance and related traits [water loss rate (WLR), body water content (BWC), body lipid content (BLC) and body mass] in adult flies across a range of temperature (20-30°C) and relative humidity (0-99{\%}) combinations in four tsetse species from both xeric and mesic habitats. WLRs were significantly affected by measurement under different temperature and relative humidity combinations, while BWC, BLC, and body mass were less affected. These results provide support for mass-independent inter- and intra-specific variation in WLRs and survival times. Furthermore, water balance responses to variation in temperature and relative humidity are complex in Glossina, and this response varies within and among species, subgroups, and ecotypes in terms of both magnitude of effects and the direction of change. Different effects of temperature and relative humidity within and among experimental conditions and species suggests cuticular permeability and saturation deficit are likely to be key factors in forecasting tsetse water balance responses to climate variability. This complicates potential forecasting of tsetse distribution in the face of climate change. {\textcopyright} 2011 Kleynhans and Terblanche.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Ackley, Hargrove. Human and animal trypanosomiasis, spread by tsetse flies (Glossina spp), is a major public health concern in much of sub-Saharan Africa. The basic reproduction number of vector-borne diseases, such as trypanosomiasis, is a function of vector mortality rate. Robust methods for estimating tsetse mortality are thus of interest for understanding population and disease dynamics and for optimal control. Existing methods for estimating mortality in adult tsetse, from ovarian dissection data, often use invalid assumptions of the existence of a stable age distribution, and age-invariant mortality and capture probability. We develop a dynamic model to estimate tsetse mortality from ovarian dissection data in populations where the age distribution is not necessarily stable. The models correspond to several hypotheses about how temperature affects mortality: no temperature dependence (model 1), identical temperature dependence for mature adults and immature stages, i.e., pupae and newly emerged adults (model 2), and differential temperature dependence for mature adults and immature stages (model 3). We fit our models to ovarian dissection data for G. pallidipes collected at Rekomitjie Research Station in the Zambezi Valley in Zimbabwe. We compare model fits to determine the most probable model, given the data, by calculating the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) for each model. The model that allows for a differential dependence of temperature on mortality for immature stages and mature adults (model 3) performs significantly better than models 1 and 2. All models produce mortality estimates, for mature adults, of approximately 3{\%} per day for mean daily temperatures below 25°C, consistent with those of mark-recapture studies performed in other settings. For temperatures greater than 25°C, mortality among immature classes of tsetse increases substantially, whereas mortality remains roughly constant for mature adults. As a sensitivity analysis, model 3 was simultaneously fit to both the ovarian dissection and trap data; while this fit also produces comparable mortality at temperatures below 25°C, it is not possible to obtain good fits to both data sources simultaneously, highlighting the uncertain correspondence between trap catches and population levels and/or the need for further improvements to our model. The modelling approach employed here could be applied to any substantial time series of age distribution data.},

abstract = {Decision-making and financial planning for tsetse control is complex, with a particularly wide range of choices to be made on location, timing, strategy and methods. This paper presents full cost estimates for eliminating or continuously controlling tsetse in a hypothetical area of 10,000km2 located in south-eastern Uganda. Four tsetse control techniques were analysed: (i) artificial baits (insecticide-treated traps/targets), (ii) insecticide-treated cattle (ITC), (iii) aerial spraying using the sequential aerosol technique (SAT) and (iv) the addition of the sterile insect technique (SIT) to the insecticide-based methods (i-iii).For the creation of fly-free zones and using a 10{\%} discount rate, the field costs per km2 came to US{\$}283 for traps (4 traps per km2), US{\$}30 for ITC (5 treated cattle per km2 using restricted application), US{\$}380 for SAT and US{\$}758 for adding SIT. The inclusion of entomological and other preliminary studies plus administrative overheads adds substantially to the overall cost, so that the total costs become US{\$}482 for traps, US{\$}220 for ITC, US{\$}552 for SAT and US{\$}993 - 1365 if SIT is added following suppression using another method. These basic costs would apply to trouble-free operations dealing with isolated tsetse populations. Estimates were also made for non-isolated populations, allowing for a barrier covering 10{\%} of the intervention area, maintained for 3 years. Where traps were used as a barrier, the total cost of elimination increased by between 29{\%} and 57{\%} and for ITC barriers the increase was between 12{\%} and 30{\%}.In the case of continuous tsetse control operations, costs were estimated over a 20-year period and discounted at 10{\%}. Total costs per km2 came to US{\$}368 for ITC, US{\$}2114 for traps, all deployed continuously, and US{\$}2442 for SAT applied at 3-year intervals. The lower costs compared favourably with the regular treatment of cattle with prophylactic trypanocides (US{\$}3862 per km2 assuming four doses per annum at 45 cattle per km2).Throughout the study, sensitivity analyses were conducted to explore the impact on cost estimates of different densities of ITC and traps, costs of baseline studies and discount rates. The present analysis highlights the cost differentials between the different intervention techniques, whilst attesting to the significant progress made over the years in reducing field costs. Results indicate that continuous control activities can be cost-effective in reducing tsetse populations, especially where the creation of fly-free zones is challenging and reinvasion pressure high. {\textcopyright} 2013 Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.},

abstract = {Background: African trypanosomiasis, also known as "sleeping sickness" in humans and "nagana" in livestock is an important vector-borne disease in Sub-Saharan Africa. Control of trypanosomiasis has focused on eliminating the vector, the tsetse fly (. Glossina, spp.). Effective tsetse fly control planning requires models to predict tsetse population and distribution changes over time and space. Traditional planning models have used statistical tools to predict tsetse distributions and have been hindered by limited field survey data. Methodology/results: We developed an Agent-Based Model (ABM) to provide timing and location information for tsetse fly control without presence/absence training data. The model is driven by daily remotely-sensed environment data. The model provides a flexible tool linking environmental changes with individual biology to analyze tsetse control methods such as aerial insecticide spraying, wild animal control, releasing irradiated sterile tsetse males, and land use and cover modification. Significance: This is a bottom-up process-based model with freely available data as inputs that can be easily transferred to a new area. The tsetse population simulation more closely approximates real conditions than those using traditional statistical models making it a useful tool in tsetse fly control planning.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: To evaluate the relative effectiveness of tsetse control methods, their costs need to be analysed alongside their impact on tsetse populations. Very little has been published on the costs of methods specifically targeting human African trypanosomiasis.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In northern Uganda, a 250 km2 field trial was undertaken using small (0.5 X 0.25 m) insecticide-treated targets ("tiny targets"). Detailed cost recording accompanied every phase of the work. Costs were calculated for this operation as if managed by the Ugandan vector control services: removing purely research components of the work and applying local salaries. This calculation assumed that all resources are fully used, with no spare capacity. The full cost of the operation was assessed at USD 85.4 per km2, of which USD 55.7 or 65.2{\%} were field costs, made up of three component activities (target deployment: 34.5{\%}, trap monitoring: 10.6{\%} and target maintenance: 20.1{\%}). The remaining USD 29.7 or 34.8{\%} of the costs were for preliminary studies and administration (tsetse surveys: 6.0{\%}, sensitisation of local populations: 18.6{\%} and office support: 10.2{\%}). Targets accounted for only 12.9{\%} of the total cost, other important cost components were labour (24.1{\%}) and transport (34.6{\%}).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nDISCUSSION: Comparison with the updated cost of historical HAT vector control projects and recent estimates indicates that this work represents a major reduction in cost levels. This is attributed not just to the low unit cost of tiny targets but also to the organisation of delivery, using local labour with bicycles or motorcycles. Sensitivity analyses were undertaken, investigating key prices and assumptions. It is believed that these costs are generalizable to other HAT foci, although in more remote areas, with denser vegetation and fewer people, costs would increase, as would be the case for other tsetse control techniques.},

abstract = {A spatial model of tsetse (Glossina palpalis ssp. and G. pallidipes) life cycle was created in FORTRAN, and four control measures [aerial spraying of non-residual insecticides, traps and targets, insecticide-treated livestock (ITL) and the sterile insect technique] were programmed into the model to assess how much of each of various combinations of these control tactics would be necessary to eradicate the population. The model included density-independent and -dependent mortality rates, temperature-dependent mortality, an age-dependent mortality, two mechanisms of dispersal and a component of aggregation. Sensitivity analyses assessed the importance of various life history features and indicated that female fertility and factors affecting survivorship had the greatest impact on the equilibrium of the female population. The female equilibrium was likewise reduced when dispersal and aggregation were acting together. Sensitivity analyses showed that basic female survivorship, age-dependent and temperature-dependent survivorship of adults, teneral-specific survivorship, daily female fertility, and mean temperature had the greatest effect on the four applied control measures. Time to eradication was reduced by initial knockdown of the population and due to the synergism of certain combinations of methods [e. g., traps-targets and sterile insect technique (SIT); ITL and SIT]. Competitive ability of the sterile males was an important parameter when sterile to wild male overflooding ratios were small. An aggregated wild population reduced the efficiency of the SIT, but increased it with increased dispersal. The model can be used interactively to facilitate decision making during the planning and implementation of operational area-wide integrated pest management programs against tsetse. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Society of Population Ecology and Springer.},

The ovarian age and uterine content were recorded, as were the lengths (l(1), l(2) and l(u)) of the largest and second largest oocyte, and of any uterine inclusion. Major abnormalities and abnormal spermathecal contents were found in {\textless} 0.1{\%} of all flies dissected. Apparent abortions rates varied significantly between dissectors and occurred at frequencies of 0.8-4.5{\%} in G. m. morsitans and 0.3-2.8{\%} in G. pallidipes. The lowest estimates give the best picture of the field situation. Abortion rates were higher in flies caught on electric nets than in trapped flies where the rate was only 0.15{\%}, indicating that reproductive losses are negligible for most of the year at Rekomitjie. The rates did, however, increase to {\textgreater} 2{\%} when mean temperatures exceeded 27 degrees C and flies were captured in artificial refuges. There was little effect of ovarian age on the abortion rate, but the frequency of empty uteri declined markedly with age - with a suggestion, however, that it might increase again in the oldest flies. A knowledge of the rates of reproductive loss is important for the construction of realistic models of the dynamics of tsetse populations.},

Vector control, the backbone of intensive efforts to remove the human and livestock trypanosomosis problem, has been typified by spectacular successes and failures. There is widespread agreement that integrated vector control, combined with direct disease treatment and prevention, has to play a major role in alleviating the tsetse burden in Africa. Mathematical and computer-based simulation models have been extensively used to try to understand how best to manage these control efforts. Such models in ecology have been helpful in giving broad generalizations about population dynamics and control. Unfortunately, in many ways they have inadequately addressed key aspects of the fly's biology and ecology, particularly the spatio-temporal variability of its habitats. These too must factor in any control efforts. Mathematical models have inherent limitations that must be considered in their use for control programs. In this review, we consider some of the controversies being debated within the field of ecology and evolution about the use of mathematical models and critically review several models that have been influential in structuring tsetse control efforts. We also make recommendations on the appropriate role that mathematical and simulation models should play when used for these purposes. Management programs are often vulnerable to naively using these models inappropriately. The questions raised in this review will apply broadly to many conservation and area-wide pest control programs with an ecological component relying on mathematical and computer simulation models to inform their decisions.},

abstract = {Mosquito-borne diseases are causing a substantial burden of mortality, morbidity and economic loss in many parts of the world, despite current control efforts, and new complementary approaches to controlling these diseases are needed. One promising class of new interventions under development involves the heritable modification of the mosquito by insertion of novel genes into the nucleus or of Wolbachia endosymbionts into the cytoplasm. Once released into a target population, these modifications can act to reduce one or more components of the mosquito population's vectorial capacity (e.g. the number of female mosquitoes, their longevity or their ability to support development and transmission of the pathogen). Some of the modifications under development are designed to be self-limiting, in that they will tend to disappear over time in the absence of recurrent releases (and hence are similar to the sterile insect technique, SIT), whereas other modifications are designed to be self-sustaining, spreading through populations even after releases stop (and hence are similar to traditional biological control). Several successful field trials have now been performed with Aedes mosquitoes, and such trials are helping to define the appropriate developmental pathway for this new class of intervention. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Authors.},

abstract = {The effectiveness of odour-baited targets treated with 0.8{\%} deltamethrin in controlling Glossina austeni Newstead and G. brevipalpis Newstead (Diptera: Glossinidae) was evaluated in Zululand, South Africa. Targets were initially deployed in the three habitat types (grassland, woodland and forest) of two adjacent areas at a density of four targets per km(2). One area functioned as the treatment block (c. 35 km(2)) and included the focus of the target deployment, and the second area functioned as a barrier block (c. 40 km(2)) against tsetse fly re-invasion from the untreated area to the south. After 8 months, targets were removed from open grassland in both areas and target density in wooded habitats and sand forest was increased to eight per km(2). Twelve months later, all targets were removed from the barrier block and used to increase target density in the wooded and sand forest habitats of the treatment block to 12 per km(2). This target density was maintained for 14 months. In the treatment area, a 99{\%} reduction in G. austeni females occurred after 13 months at a target density of eight per km(2) in wooded habitat; this was maintained for 22 months. Reduction in G. brevipalpis was less marked. The relatively poor reduction in G. brevipalpis is attributed to the high mobility of this species and its distribution throughout less wooded and more open habitats.},

abstract = {The age, insemination and ovulation status of tsetse flies Glossina pallidipes Austen (n = 154369) and Glossina morsitans morsitans Westwood (n = 19659), captured over 11 years in Zimbabwe, are assessed by ovarian dissection. Instantaneous rates of insemination increase exponentially with age in both species; 90{\%} insemination levels are reached after 5 days post-emergence in G. m. morsitans and 7 days in G. pallidipes, varying little with season. More than 95{\%} of both species have ovulated by the age of 8 days and 99{\%} by 12 days. Older flies that have not ovulated are {\textgreater} 100-fold more likely to be caught in October and November than in other months. A 500-fold decrease in trap catches did not result in any detectible decrease in the probability of females being inseminated. The proportion of partially filled spermathecae rises for approximately 6 days then declines, consistent with some flies having mated more than once. For flies caught on electric nets, with wings undamaged during capture, wing-fray data are used to extend ovarian age estimates up to 11 ovulations. Among these flies, the volume of sperm in the spermathecae declines little in flies that have ovulated up to seven times; thereafter, it declines by approximately 1{\%} per ovulation. The time course of insemination and the mating frequency of females are important considerations in modelling tsetse fly populations, as well as for the dynamics of interventions involving the release of genetically-modified insects, which should not be seriously compromised by the limited levels of polyandry currently observed. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Royal Entomological Society.},

abstract = {Ovarian ages were obtained for tsetse flies Glossina morsitans morsitans Westwood and G. pallidipes Austen caught in Zimbabwe using a stationary bait ox, an odour-baited trap in the presence or absence of humans, a mobile ox fly-round and a vehicle-mounted electric net. The biggest daily catches were obtained from the electric net and the unaccompanied trap, but while for G. m. morsitans the ratio of the catches from these two methods was 7:1, for G. pallidipes it was 0.7:1. Evening catches were 1.3-5.5 and 2.9-18.8 times higher than morning catches for the two species, respectively; the differences were greater for stationary than for mobile baits. The sample age structures differed signficantly (P {\textless} 0.05: X2) between methods in six of the ten possible contrasts between pairs of methods in G. m. morsitans and for all ten in G. pallidipes. The differences in age distribution and mean catch levels are attributed to increases in flight activity with age; at each age G. pallidipes is more active than G. m. morsitans. Man's presence in the trapping system reduced catches significantly (P {\textless} 0.05: t test) but this effect was small in the youngest and oldest flies. Odour-baited traps are biased in favour of G. pallidipes and, for both species, in favour of older flies; mortalities calculated from age distributions of trap samples therefore underestimate the true value.},
