abstract = {A way of estimating average daily mortality rates of female tsetse from ovarian age distributions was presented. This technique was applied to monthly biconical trap samples of G. palpalis taken during and after insecticidal (endosulfan) campaigns in the Bouafle region of Ivory Coast. A clear inverse relationship is demonstrated between the annual mean number of females per trap per sample at 10 separate sites and the mean annual mortality rates calculated for them. Local variation in the impact of insecticides is explained in terms of the grouping of the sites either side of a level of natural mortality above which tsetse population cannot be sustained through reproduction alone. A theoretical (mathematical) model for density dependent population growth is presented and applied to a particular control situation, that of the sterile insect release method. The model demonstrates that the effectiveness of any particular level of induced sterility (or mortality) is crucially determined by the natural resilience of the target population.},

abstract = {Tsetse exhibit a U-shaped age-mortality curve, with high losses after eclosion and a well-marked ageing process, which is particularly dramatic in males. A three-parameter (k(1) -k(3) ) model for age-dependent adult instantaneous mortality rates was constructed using mark-recapture data for the tsetse fly Glossina morsitans morsitans Westwood (Diptera: Glossinidae). Mortality changed linearly with k(1) over all ages; k(2) affected only losses in roughly the first week of adult life, and k(3) controlled the ageing rate. Mortality pooled over age was twice as sensitive to changes in k(3) as in k(1) . Population growth rate was, however, similarly affected by these two parameters, reflecting the disproportionate effect of k(3) on mortality in the oldest flies that contribute least to the growth rate. Pooled-age mortality and growth rate were insensitive to changes in k(2) . The same model also provided good fits to data for laboratory colonies of female G. m. morsitans and Glossina austeni Newstead and should be applicable to all tsetse of both sexes. The new model for tsetse mortality should be incorporated into models of tsetse and trypanosome population dynamics; it will also inform the estimation of adult female mortality from ovarian dissection data.},

abstract = {Existing attempts to estimate the survival rate of tsetse flies from ovarian age distributions generally assume that the population is stationary. The fact that the survival rate cannot be dissociated from the growth rate by these methods poses a problem. Under the assumption of a stable age distribution, we propose a maximum likelihood method to estimate the ?apparent survival rate? for three categories of females: nulliparous (b0), young parous (b1) and old parous flies (b2). The rate depends both on ?real survival rates? a0, a1 and a2, and a growth rate l: b0 = a0/l, b1 = a1/l, and b2 = a2/l. We used a matrix model, which can be parameterized if the pupal survival rate and the pupal period are known. Replacing a0, a1 and a2 by b0,l, b1l, and b2l in the projection matrix, the problem amounts to calculating its dominant eigen-value l, and hence a0, a1 and a2. The application to a field population of Glossina palpalis gambiensis Vanderplank in Burkina Faso showed there was a marked difference in survival rate according to age category. The average survival rate increased with age with decreasing variability. The results suggested that sampling (by trapping) may have had an effect on the dynamics of this tsetse population by ageing it artificially. This method may be a useful tool for monitoring tsetse control.},

abstract = {Environmental temperature is an important driver of the population dynamics of tsetse ( Glossina spp) because the fly's immature stages are particularly vulnerable to temperatures ( T ) outside the range T = 16–32°C. Laboratory experiments carried out 50 years ago provide extensive measures of temperature-dependent rates of development, fat consumption and mortality in tsetse pupae. We improve on the models originally fitted to these data, providing better parameter estimates for use in population modelling. A composite function accurately models rates of pupal development for T = 8–32°C. Pupal duration can be estimated by summing the temperature-dependent daily percentage of development completed. Fat consumption is modelled as a logistic function of temperature; the total fat consumed during pupal development takes a minimum for T ≈ 25°C. Pupae experiencing constant temperatures {\textless}16°C exhaust their fat reserves before they complete development. At high temperatures, direct effects kill the pupae before fat stores are exhausted. The relationship between pupal mortality and temperature is well described by the sum of two exponential functions. Summing daily mortality rates over the whole pupal period does not reliably predict overall mortality. Mortality is more strongly correlated with the mean temperature experienced over pupal life or, for T ≤ 30°C, the fat consumption during this period. The new results will be particularly useful in the construction of various models for tsetse population dynamics, and will have particular relevance for agent-based models where the lives of individual tsetse are simulated using a daily time step.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Tsetse flies occur in much of sub-Saharan Africa where they are vectors of trypanosomes that cause human and animal African trypanosomosis. The sterile insect technique (SIT) is currently used to eliminate tsetse fly populations in an area-wide integrated pest management (AW-IPM) context in Senegal and Ethiopia. Three Glossina palpalis gambiensis strains [originating from Burkina Faso (BKF), Senegal (SEN) and an introgressed strain (SENbkf)] were established and are now available for use in future AW-IPM programmes against trypanosomes in West Africa. For each strain, knowledge of the environmental survival thresholds is essential to determine which of these strains is best suited to a particular environment or ecosystem, and can therefore be used effectively in SIT programmes. METHODS In this paper, we investigated the survival and fecundity of three G. p. gambiensis strains maintained under various conditions: 25 °C and 40, 50, 60, and 75 {\%} relative humidity (rH), 30 °C and 60 {\%} rH and 35 °C and 60 {\%} rH. RESULTS The survival of the three strains was dependent on temperature only, and it was unaffected by changing humidity within the tested range. The BKF strain survived temperatures above its optimum better than the SEN strain. The SENbkf showed intermediate resistance to high temperatures. A temperature of about 32 °C was the limit for survival for all strains. A rH ranging from 40 to 76 {\%} had no effect on fecundity at 25-26 °C. CONCLUSIONS We discuss the implications of these results on tsetse SIT-based control programmes.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Ackley, Hargrove. Human and animal trypanosomiasis, spread by tsetse flies (Glossina spp), is a major public health concern in much of sub-Saharan Africa. The basic reproduction number of vector-borne diseases, such as trypanosomiasis, is a function of vector mortality rate. Robust methods for estimating tsetse mortality are thus of interest for understanding population and disease dynamics and for optimal control. Existing methods for estimating mortality in adult tsetse, from ovarian dissection data, often use invalid assumptions of the existence of a stable age distribution, and age-invariant mortality and capture probability. We develop a dynamic model to estimate tsetse mortality from ovarian dissection data in populations where the age distribution is not necessarily stable. The models correspond to several hypotheses about how temperature affects mortality: no temperature dependence (model 1), identical temperature dependence for mature adults and immature stages, i.e., pupae and newly emerged adults (model 2), and differential temperature dependence for mature adults and immature stages (model 3). We fit our models to ovarian dissection data for G. pallidipes collected at Rekomitjie Research Station in the Zambezi Valley in Zimbabwe. We compare model fits to determine the most probable model, given the data, by calculating the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) for each model. The model that allows for a differential dependence of temperature on mortality for immature stages and mature adults (model 3) performs significantly better than models 1 and 2. All models produce mortality estimates, for mature adults, of approximately 3{\%} per day for mean daily temperatures below 25°C, consistent with those of mark-recapture studies performed in other settings. For temperatures greater than 25°C, mortality among immature classes of tsetse increases substantially, whereas mortality remains roughly constant for mature adults. As a sensitivity analysis, model 3 was simultaneously fit to both the ovarian dissection and trap data; while this fit also produces comparable mortality at temperatures below 25°C, it is not possible to obtain good fits to both data sources simultaneously, highlighting the uncertain correspondence between trap catches and population levels and/or the need for further improvements to our model. The modelling approach employed here could be applied to any substantial time series of age distribution data.},

@article{Amarasekare2013,
abstract = {Summary: Lately, there has been interest in using the intrinsic growth rate (rm) to predict the effects of climate warming on ectotherm population viability. However, because rm is calculated using the Euler-Lotka equation, its reliability in predicting population persistence depends on whether ectotherm populations can achieve a stable age/stage distribution in thermally variable environments. Here, we investigate this issue using a mathematical framework that incorporates mechanistic descriptions of temperature effects on vital rates into a stage-structured population model that realistically captures the temperature-induced variability in developmental delays that characterize ectotherm life cycles. We find that populations experiencing seasonal temperature variation converge to a stage distribution whose intra-annual pattern remains invariant across years. As a result, the mean annual per capita growth rate also remains constant between years. The key insight is the mechanism that allows populations converge to a stationary stage distribution. Temperature effects on the biochemical processes (e.g. enzyme kinetics, hormonal regulation) that underlie life-history traits (reproduction, development and mortality) exhibit well-defined thermodynamical properties (e.g. changes in entropy and enthalpy) that lead to predictable outcomes (e.g. reduction in reaction rates or hormonal action at temperature extremes). As a result, life-history traits exhibit a systematic and predictable response to seasonal temperature variation. This in turn leads to temporally predictable temperature responses of the stage distribution and the per capita growth rate. When climate warming causes an increase in the mean annual temperature and/or the amplitude of seasonal fluctuations, the population model predicts the mean annual per capita growth rate to decline to zero within 100 years when warming is slow relative to the developmental period of the organism (0{\textperiodcentered}03-0{\textperiodcentered}05{\{}ring operator{\}}C per year) and to become negative, causing population extinction, well before 100 years when warming is fast (e.g. 0{\textperiodcentered}1{\{}ring operator{\}}C per year). The Euler-Lotka equation predicts a slower decrease in rm when warming is slow and a longer persistence time when warming is fast, with the deviation between the two metrics increasing with increasing developmental period. These results suggest that predictions of ectotherm population viability based on rm may be valid only for species with short developmental delays, and even then, only over short time-scales and under slow warming regimes. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Authors.

abstract = {The typical short generation length of insects makes their population dynamics highly sensitive not only to mean annual temperatures but also to their intra-annual variations. To consider the combined effect of both thermal factors under global warming, we propose a modeling framework that links general circulation models (GCMs) with a stochastic weather generator and population dynamics models to predict species population responses to inter- and intra-annual temperature changes. Here, this framework was utilized to explore future changes in populations of Bemisia tabaci, an invasive insect pest-species that affects multiple agricultural systems in the Mediterranean region. We considered three locations representing different pest status and climatic conditions: Montpellier (France), Seville (Spain) and Beit-Jamal (Israel). We produced ensembles of local daily temperature realizations representing current and future (mid 21-century) climatic conditions under two emission scenarios for the three locations. Our simulations predicted a significant increase in the average number of annual generations and in population size, and a significant lengthening of the growing season in all three locations. A negative effect was found only in Seville for the summer season, where future temperatures lead to a reduction in population size. High variability in population size was observed between years with similar annual mean temperatures, suggesting a strong effect of intra-annual temperature variation. Critical periods were from late spring to late summer in Montpellier and from late winter to early summer in Seville and Beit-Jamal. Although our analysis suggested that earlier seasonal activity does not necessarily lead to increased populations load unless an additional generation is produced, it is highly likely that the insect will become a significant pest of open-fields at Mediterranean latitudes above 40° during the next 50 years. Our simulations also implied that current predictions based on mean temperature anomalies are relatively conservative and it is better to apply stochastic tools to resolve complex responses to climate change while taking natural variability into account. In summary, we propose here a modeling framework capable of determining distinct intra-annual temperature patterns leading to large or small population sizes, for pest risk assessment and management planning of both natural and agricultural ecosystems.},

abstract = {The intrinsic rate of population increase (rmax) is a fundamental metric in ecology and evolution of immediate practical application in conservation and wildlife management. I examine the interpretation of rmax by revisiting the theory behind the density-independent and density-dependent paradigms. The criticism that density-independent approaches underestimate rmax per se, often expressed in the field of fisheries, is shown to be theoretically unfounded. The difficulty in estimating rmax is due to lack of knowledge on the depletion level of the population rather than theory. I reviewed a method commonly used to estimate extinction risk of marine and terrestrial populations and show that it has been used incorrectly. I also examined five other methods to calculate rmax, the Euler–Lotka equation, and four other methods derived from it. I used the same data inputs for a suite of 65 shark populations with a broad range of life histories as an example to show that the incorrectly used extinction risk method overestimates rmax. I compared the rmax values for sharks obtained with the incorrectly applied extinction risk method to published values for other vertebrate taxa to further show that this method generates implausible values for this group of predators. I advocate focusing on obtaining estimates of all required vital rates simultaneously when possible while taking into consideration the exploitation history of the population under study as a pragmatic way to provide plausible estimates of rmax. The Euler–Lotka equation and its derivations are recommended for different degrees of data availability, particularly for slow- and medium-growing populations, to provide sensible advice for conservation and management of living vertebrates in situations where a series of credible abundance estimates are not available as is often the case in marine systems. Methods that combine allometry and demography should also be further explored.},

abstract = {Growth rates of tsetse populations were estimated by calculating the dominant eigenvalues of appropriate Leslie matrices. The individual effects of four variables (pre-adult and adult survival probability, interlarval period and pupal duration), have been investigated by varying each one over a wide range of values, while the other three are held constant. R, the log of the growth rate, was found to vary approximately linearly with adult and pre-adult death rate; a 1{\%} change in the adult death rate causes approximately a 10-fold change in R. R varies linearly with the log of fecundity and of the pupal duration. An increase in the pupal duration results in a decrease in the growth rate for populations which have a positive growth rate, but an increase for populations which have a negative growth rate. For a population at equilibrium, a change in the pupal duration has no effect. Small changes in fecundity have less effect on the growth rate than small changes in the death rate; this fact is advanced as an important contributor to the generally very cautious nature of female tsetse, and their aversion to man, particularly as a potential host. A simple linear model is described which relates R to all four variables and their first order interactions. The model is used to produce a set of graphs which encapsulate the relationship between the growth rate and the vital parameters over a wide range of values. It is also used to draw the loci on one side of which tsetse populations grow, and on the other of which they decline. Population resilience is discussed in relation to the problem of tsetse eradication; it is concluded that if one can impose and sustain an added mortality of 4{\%} per day on any female tsetse population then it must go extinct, regardless of the strength of the density dependent processes; and it seems likely that in most field conditions only an added 2-3{\%} is required. It is pointed out that ground and aerial spraying techniques produce much higher daily mortalities than this, but they may often not be sustained for sufficiently long to achieve eradication. When odour-baited targets are used the increased death rate is much smaller, but it can be sustained as required; recent work in Zimbabwe shows that there is a good correspondence between the calculated imposed death rate and the observed rate of decline of tsetse populations.},
